<p>Unexpected Catharsis</p>
<p>It had been 15 years since I’d talked to him <a href="/item02"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a>… maybe a few calls here and there… taking care of papers, admin, things like that. Not the type of relationship I wanted to have… not the type of relationship we used to have. But that’s the way it was. That’s the way it’s been… and now, I can’t go back and change any of that. I’m stuck with the memory of, well, of having no memory of the last 15 years… that is to say, we shared nothing, made no new memories. It was all blank space in terms of us. There was very little there. When I heard he had his stroke, I couldn’t move. I froze, emotionless, in shock, and carried on what I was doing. I wanted to cry, to break down right there and then, but I couldn’t. First, I was stuck at work, where there’s the ever-present pressure to be on your game, to be strong and in charge, to not break down in front of the young ones. Second, I suddenly felt completely out of control of what was happening inside me, like being stranded in a lifeboat amidst a huge ocean, turbulent and dark, with waves the size of foothills barreling towards me from every direction. It was a mix of heartbreak, grief, anger, frustration, and resentment… betrayed by 15 years of silence.</p>
<p>“Frank… Frank… FRANK!” <a href="/item03"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a> It was Amanda. She and I had been working on a pharmaceuticals account for months. We were in the middle of preparing for a pitch tomorrow and now this. “Are you okay?” she asked. We usually didn’t get too personal at work. There was that fine line, but this… this was different. I wanted to tell her, to let her know what was going on. I guess the perfect storm raging on the inside had left me dazed and stone-faced on the exterior.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a family emergency.”</p>
<p>“Everything okay?”</p>
<p>“No. Not really.”</p>
<p>“Shit.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I know.”</p>
<p>“So that’s it for today? Cancel tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“Can you do it on your own?”</p>
<p>“I can try.”</p>
<p>“This really isn’t ideal…” I tried to keep it professional, “but I’ve got to go.”</p>
<p>“Shit. It’s bad.”</p>
<p>“It’s my father.”</p>
<p>She looked at me and I could see her expression change. I must have let something slip. There was no good poker face for this.</p>
<p>“Alright. Go. I’ve got this. Don’t worry about anything. Just go. I’ll let HR know what’s going on.”</p>
<p>I got out as fast as I could avoiding small talk in the halls, praying for the empty elevator that took an eternity to arrive as the past came flooding back, image by image.</p>
<p>The ride to the hospital was a blur. He had been in a coma and there was little to do but wait. It was silence, tears, hugs between my sister and I, his two kids. Her niece Matilda was there. An odd girl that I never really understood, but tried to over the years. She often felt distant, but today, she was warm. There was little else to be. We waited for hours but he was slipping away slowly.</p>
<p>The nurses came and went, and mostly left us alone. There was just one thing. His bunny. </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="3"></p>
<p>Now, I’m not a fan of animals. I had a gerbil growing up that would gnaw the fingers off the action figures I placed in his cage. That was years ago and I was a child. This useless little creature was accountable for nothing. It wasn’t a dog that could fetch and roll over. It was a bunny. Bunnies are nervous, timid creatures that don’t really offer the world anything other than a meditative stroke across its back. What’s so fun about feeding something carrots? What’s so great about a thing that is just cute for cute’s sake? Nothing. Nothing at all. So why did he want a bunny? Why did he trade his family for this little piece of shit? I guess it was his old age. He’s had it for years. Had it since we had our fight. Had it since he started getting lonely. But it was just the bunny that he needed. I guess he needed that damn thing more than he needed a family. He’d literally replaced us with a bunny. Why? Who knows. Well, one thing was for sure. It’s little brain in there, that pilot controlling his thoughts and actions, that was the thing that replaced us. This new line of half biological, half artificial assistants always creeped me the fuck out. Live animals with artificial intelligence built in? I didn’t get it. Give me a dog any day. Really. Give me a dog, it was time I invested in some all-natural life around here. I advertised the damn things, but I didn’t get it. I was good at selling them. It was like taking candy from a baby. So simple. Pictures of smiling, happy people holding up these little animals to the sun. What a better, brighter day. Less lonely, with a just a hint of the rising overlord take-over. And now, watching my father slip away, this little fuck has to chime in and ask how I’m doing? I’ll tell you how I’m doing, I’m watching my family slip away and you, the only one he spent any time with, you are now making small talk, wanting to know all about me and tell me the history of this building. This little piece of shit needs some sensitivity training. Where is the off button?</p>
<p>“Nurse. Can we do something with this bunny?” I was sure there was a broom closet somewhere that we could stash him. Hell, give me a trash compactor.</p>
<p>“Mr. Harris, he belongs to your father. I don’t have a say as to what happens to him.”</p>
<p>“Well who does?”</p>
<p>“In all honesty, he’s yours now. Yours or your sisters.” Mine or my sisters? Sister, definitely.</p>
<p>“Alright. Thank you miss.” This was not alright.</p>
<p>The bunny sat on the chair next to me as I watched my father’s vitals.</p>
<p>“What’s your name?” I asked the bunny.</p>
<p>“Toki. But Steven called me Brother.”</p>
<p>“I’m calling you Toki.”</p>
<p>“Alright Frank.”</p>
<p>“Just sit there please. Give me some peace, will you? No more chatting. I’ve got to go talk to my sister.”</p>
<p>“Alright Frank.”</p>
<p>There was no way I was keeping it. It would end up a stew. How do you make bunny stew?</p>
<p>“Sister, I got to talk to you.”</p>
<p>“What is it Frank?”</p>
<p>“You’ve got to take that bunny.”</p>
<p>“I’d love to Frank but George is allergic.” At this point it was clear to me, that no amount of arguing was going to help. Once she’d made up her mind, it was over. George… always ruining everything. “And plus, Matilda has already asked me to keep that thing away from her.”</p>
<p>“Matilda?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. She’s against them.” <a href="/item04"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>“Matilda. Well, I can’t blame her, but if that thing ends up as a pair of slippers for your next birthday, don’t say I didn’t warn you.” </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="4"></p>
<p>“I wouldn’t worry about it Frank. You’ll have to return it to the insurance agency anyhow. It’s theirs technically.”</p>
<p>“Can’t they take it now?”</p>
<p>“Well. Not until… not until he goes.” She looked down. It was not the time… “I just don’t understand where he went to all these years.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t getting any better, but he wasn’t getting any worse.</p>
<p>“We should go.” My sister didn’t have much patience for him any more.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>We called it for the night around midnight and I headed home.</p>
<p>“Do you have a box or something for the bunny?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Steven must have taken him to the theater in this.” The nurse handed me an old shoebox with holes cut into it.</p>
<p>“Thanks.” I turned to the bunny, who sat intently by the wall. “So, what, you just get in the box now? Here bunny. Here bunny.”</p>
<p>“My name is Toki.” He hopped to my feet and lifted up on two legs. I reached down for him, lifted him to my eyes and took a good look. What the hell was going on in there? I packed him up took him home, and laid a towel in the box so he’d have somewhere to sleep.</p>
<p>“You alright here?”</p>
<p>“Other than a little hungry, I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“I have to feed you?”</p>
<p>“Vegetables always work. I require some extra nutrition to keep my functioning properly, but we can discuss that in the morning. You seem tired.”</p>
<p>I seem tired? “What about this?” I offered him some uncooked Brussels sprouts.</p>
<p>“This will do for now. I’m sorry for what’s happening with your father. It’s a terrible thing. I tried to keep him healthy, to keep him going, but there were some habits that he never gave up.”</p>
<p>“Don’t mention him.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Of course”</p>
<p>“Are you alright out here? Can I just leave you to wander around or do I need to lock you in the bathroom or something?”</p>
<p>“Out here is fine. I can control myself.”</p>
<p>“And you won’t sh… you won’t… defecate on the rug?”</p>
<p>“I can use the toilet. It’s the door on the way in correct? Just make sure it’s ajar and I’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>“It’s good. Whatever you say. Goodnight bunny.” How long could this last?</p>
<p>I barely slept. The years snuck back in, posed as feverish nightmare, relentless. Every time I’d start to drift, they’d be there, over and over. Darkness eventually turned to wandering shadows as the light from the morning crept across the room. I was awakened by a phone call around 6:30. It was my sister. He had passed in the night. Just like that. We should have stayed. We should have been there. And there it was. It finally hit me. Overwhelmed and exhausted, I wept, and stared at the ceiling. I was orphaned, again. The second time he disappeared. This time, for good.</p>
<p>“Is everything alright?” It was the god damn bunny at the door.</p>
<p>“Toki. You can look shit up right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Frank. Of course. What would you like?”</p>
<p>“A recipe for rabbit stew.”</p>
<p>“Sure thing Frank. Would you like me to order you the ingredients?”</p>
<p>“Everything but the rabbit.” </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="5"></p>
<p>“I sense your sarcasm, Frank. You don’t really want rabbit stew do you?”</p>
<p>“You really are a modern marvel. Just contact your maker, or whoever it is and let them know you can go home.”</p>
<p>“They already know, Frank.”</p>
<p>“They knew, and I knew the minute he passed.”</p>
<p>“You what?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Frank. I didn’t think you’d want to hear it from me. I take it you don’t like me very much.”</p>
<p>“You’re right, I don’t. When are they coming?”</p>
<p>“They’ll be here between 8 am and 4 pm.”</p>
<p>“And I’m supposed to wait here all day?”</p>
<p>“I can let them in if you’d like. You don’t have to be here. I just don’t want to be left outside. I might be stolen, or made into soup.”</p>
<p>“Whatever works. I’m going to take a bath. Let me know if you’ve got any more exciting news.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Frank.”</p>
<p>I bathed, and tried to keep my heart from pounding through my chest. I laid in silence as the memories came back. Every time I’d close my eyes, there he was. Over and over. A flood of images, words, the sound of his voice. It was all there. Over and over. So I laid, and just watched it play. I wept. And in between the soft sounds of faucet dripping, I’d hear the bunny. That little prick was the last one to know anything that happened, and now he’s here. What happens if you don’t return him?</p>
<p>“Bunny, come here.” He hopped to the door.</p>
<p>“Yes, Frank?”</p>
<p>“What happens if I don’t return you?”</p>
<p>“You are fined, or go to jail.”</p>
<p>“How much? How long?”</p>
<p>“1.2 million dollars, or 12 years.”</p>
<p>“Thank you bunny.”</p>
<p>Mother, Fucker. You know, for the piece of shit he is, he's actually kind of cute, I'll give him that. But I can't wrap my head around where the bunny stops and the artificial starts. You just kind of forget. I actually feel bad for the bunny that’s trapped in there with that brain… a puppet… a host. Whatever it is. Where does the bunny go when the pilot takes over? I can't tell if the bunny is stuck inside the machine, or the machine is stuck inside the bunny. It's one of them questions that just goes in circles... the snake that ate itself I guess. It’s enough to give me a headache. I lay back again, and watched the movie play. Well, it wasn’t much use being lonely. At least the bunny was here.</p>
<p>“Bunny!”</p>
<p>“Yes Frank?” The door to the bathroom was cracked open and he stuck his little face in.</p>
<p>“What are you doing, what have you gotten yourself into out there?</p>
<p>“Oh. I'm using my imagination. “</p>
<p>“Your imagination?”</p>
<p>“Yes. That's when things come to your mind from somewhere you can't distinctly control right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that and picturing a harem of naked of women.“</p>
<p>“Why would I do that?”</p>
<p>“You wouldn't. Well, carry on. I'll be out of here in a few minutes. Just finishing my beauty soak.”</p>
<p>“Okay, Frank.” </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="6"></p>
<p>The bunny took off into the living room. I just wanted to stay in here for a bit a while longer. The warm water felt nice... got my blood flowing. I pulled the stopper from the drain and the water gurgled as it spit down the pipe, as I heard a crash in the living room.</p>
<p>“Bunny?” No answer.</p>
<p>“Hey. Bunny. Toki. Toki? Everything okay? Toki?” I grabbed a towel and dried myself off. Did he just take a nosedive off the couch? Was it too much for him? I hope he wasn’t pissed at me. I’d have to chalk up a whole lotta dough if he did anything to himself. He wasn’t hurt though, he was furiously building, laying down pens on the floor. He’d knocked them off the desk to build with…</p>
<p>“Toki? Hey.” He didn't respond... just seemed to be in a trance or something. I knelt down and touched his back. “Toki?” He jumped.</p>
<p>“I'm sorry Frank. I don't know what happened. I don't know where time went. This is strange.”</p>
<p>“Did you make this?”</p>
<p>“Make what?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, what? All of this shit?”</p>
<p>“I don't know. I guess so...”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“It looks like a map of… nevermind.”</p>
<p>“A map of what?”</p>
<p>“It’s Steven’s home.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“I saw you, and he. You were fighting. I can’t remember. I can’t see it all.”</p>
<p>“What can you see?”</p>
<p>And then it played. His eyes lit up and shined bright on the wall. I saw the scene, the day I fought with Steven. The bunny was watching. I watched through his eyes as we argued. I watched as I smashed a picture off the wall. I watched as I stormed out. I watched as he yelled behind me as he slammed the door. Then I watched his anger turn to sadness. I watched him slide to the ground and take the bunny into his arms. I watched him pick the frame from the floor, and put it back up on the wall. It didn’t make sense. He was angry, telling me I was worthless two minutes ago, and here, here he was doing just the opposite. And the light faded.</p>
<p>“What else is there?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Frank.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean you don’t know?”</p>
<p>“That memory, I don’t know where it is.”</p>
<p>“What the fuck are you talking about? Find the memory. Search for the damn memory!”</p>
<p>“It’s not in the memory of the pilot.”</p>
<p>“Play it again. Play it again!”</p>
<p>“I’m trying but I can’t. I don’t know where it came from. It was in my imagination.”</p>
<p>“Listen. Toki. Bunny. That thing you just did. Do it again.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I’m trying to say. I can’t.”</p>
<p>No? He can’t play it again? There was only one person I knew who knew anything about this stuff. Matilda.</p>
<p>I called my sister. They were home. I put the bunny in his box and we made our way to their place, subway line by subway line. I picked up some pastries and coffee before going in. Didn’t want to be too suspicious. It was still early. She wasn’t up. My sister hadn’t told her. We sat at the kitchen table, ate and drank, tried not to lose it completely. There was too </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="7"> much going on right now. I wanted to explode. To rip the head clean off the bunny, roll it across the table to my sister and say ‘Here. It’s the last place he exists.’ But that would have ruined breakfast. There was no way this little bunny didn’t know what it had shown me. There’s no way that it didn’t know what was going on in its own brain. Matilda was the first person who would know. She got up finally, and came into the kitchen where she stopped upon seeing me. She looked to her mother and could see on her face that something had happened. She didn’t seem surprised, but knowing her own grief was nothing compared to what her mother was going through, took a step forward and held her. My sister and niece stayed like that as I listened to the clock tick. My sister left my niece there with me as she went to the bathroom to compose herself.</p>
<p>“Matilda.”</p>
<p>“Uncle Frank?”</p>
<p>“I need to ask you a serious question. How do you get the memory out of one of these things?” I opened the box and Toki stood up.</p>
<p>“You brought that here? Get it out.”</p>
<p>“I can’t. You have to help me.”</p>
<p>“I’m not helping you with that. It’s the devil.”</p>
<p>“I know it’s the devil, but it’s got… it’s got a lot of Pappa’s memory on there and I want to get it off.”</p>
<p>“Well you can’t just plug it in. Those things don’t do that. It’s a Calico thing.”</p>
<p>“Calico. The drug company.” <a href="/item05"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>“It’s recording everything we are saying and doing. Frank. Put it away. I can’t help you. And I’m not talking to you in front of it. It’s the devil.”</p>
<p>“Wait.” I grabbed her by the arm and pulled her into the side hallway. “You have to help me get this memory out of its head. It’s got Pappa in there. The last 15 years. It played it for me.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean it played it for you?”</p>
<p>“Light shot out of its eyes and it played the memory back for me. But it can’t do it again. Says it’s trapped inside the bunny’s brain. Not the pilot. You’ve got to know something about this.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s not uncommon. Those things are evil. They enslave the bunny, and take it over. You think it’s a bunny but it’s not. There have been cases, though, of the bunny keeping memories, and interrupting the system, the pilot. Listen. How bad do you want the memory off that bunny?”</p>
<p>“Pretty bad.”</p>
<p>“Pretty bad, like you’d pay someone to get the memory off?”</p>
<p>“I’m not paying you. You’re my niece.”</p>
<p>“Not me. But I know someone.”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“I’m not speaking with that thing in the house.”</p>
<p>“Yes, fine. Let’s just do it. I have to return the damn thing.”</p>
<p>“Alright. You want to see how it’s done?”</p>
<p>“How what’s done?”</p>
<p>“How to keep that devil spy from intercepting my message?”</p>
<p>“I don’t care… yes… show me.”</p>
<p>She left, and returned from her room with a small, black phone. This is an encrypted phone. It’s time you learnt how this works. Go ahead. Send. <a href="/item07"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a><a href="/item08"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a>

<div class="page" data-page="8"></p>
<p>PART II</p>
<p>Wool Over the Eyes</p>
<p>The sun was coming down heavy now. It was present. A constant reminder that this day would not stop, would not pause, would not go any other way but forward. I wanted to pause it, to hold time in a vice and get my bearings but it doesn’t work that way. The river goes where the river goes. When you’re in it, you go where the river goes. I thought of holding the waters back, finding an eddy to where I could catch my breath and plan. It was right there in front of me. The memory. That frail and fragile creature, gatekeeper to lost time, was a heartbeat away from extinction. Now, with Matilda in the picture, it made things more complex, I could only hope that we weren’t heading into a disaster. She was making plans with people I didn’t know, about something I couldn’t comprehend, that held the key to something I’d missed. One by one, the questions came. They couldn’t be tamed by the sunlight, or calmed with words. They were ever present.</p>
<p>I don’t like questions. They’re the kind of thing I try to avoid. I try to answer questions, at least to the people that need to be buying. I try to eliminate questions, to make it all seem okay. And usually it is. The questions are the things that get me down. I want to turn questions into emotion, angst into reassurance. And, now. I had none. I wanted to be able to leap from my own skin, rise above the room, fly out from where we were, from this little apartment, pull apart the day and put the pieces back together my way.</p>
<p>“Here. We go here.” Matilda returned with a hand drawn set of instructions. We were to go meet someone.</p>
<p>“We? Now?”</p>
<p>“Do you want it or not?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. We’ve just got to have a good lie to tell your mother.” Lies are better when they’re wrapped in truth. I’d just be dropping her off on my way out. She bought it. We embraced.</p>
<p>“Thanks for the coffee and pastries.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to head to the hospital to take care of everything. Will you be there?”</p>
<p>“After I take care of this little guy. George will be there. Will you be alright?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It just happened too quick.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be there later, just call.”</p>
<p>I stuffed the bunny in the box and we headed to the elevators.</p>
<p>“There’s no guarantee you know.” Matilda was trying to reassure me.</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“Do you…” She cut me off. She wouldn’t speak anymore in front of the bunny.</p>
<p>The light hurt my eyes, and the sleeplessness was starting to sink in, mixed with coffee, that strange sense of timelessness, of being on a different clock. The world moved around, and I started to feel like I was in that eddy after all. It was autopilot from there. The train. The transfers, waiting. We stopped and got food for the bunny. Rabbit food, plus some extra protein powder to keep his little brain functioning properly.</p>
<p>We got off down where the markets were, <a href="/item09"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a> busy, bustling, crowded. The market was hot, the smell of cumin and curry, fried dumplings and spice. He’d be there. I couldn’t talk to her. She went ahead, pushing her way through the crowd, leading us left, right, under canopies. I couldn’t talk to her through all the nose and chaos nor would she let me if I tried. I noticed her for the first time. She was smart. From what my sister told me, she did well in school, but it </p></div> 

<div class="page" data-page="9"> was  her other life that got her into trouble. She was partly an activist. Fighting against… well, against me really… against what I did. And I was starting not to blame her. She didn’t like all the technology… I mean, she did, apparently, but not all of it. There was something about her distrust of me, the bunny, and this city that got her into trouble, arguments at school. She started to sink away. She had her own secret world behind the walls of that house… and outside the walls of the house no less. The coloring in her hair was a hint at normalcy, but was it real? I got the sense that it was an act. She seemed to feign interest in pop culture to stay under the radar, but it was that hidden side that made her tick. What I did for a living was take everything she believed to be wrong about the world, wrap it in a pinstriped suit and send it into the boardrooms to be auctioned off as social propaganda. I didn’t know why she was helping me with this. Perhaps she wanted to know just as much as I did. Perhaps she liked the thrill of stealing a piece of million dollar equipment to give to some shady character she bought drugs from or did drugs with… I could see the two of them smoking opium together to kill the pain of an oppressive society, outsiders with nowhere to go and no one who’d listen to them. I don’t know if that’s true, but she was living in a different world and it was painfully obvious. 

<p>“We’re near. Wait here.”</p>
<p>That was all she spoke to me. I watched her black jacket disappear into the crowd as I stood like a fool in the rain, with the crowd sliding past me, a stake in the middle of a swarm of humans. The noise from the street, the conversations, they were too much. Fractions of conversations. Snippets of peoples lives, like tuning a radio. They all wandered around. They wandered, shopped, and spent their Saturday morning in one of the busiest places on earth. You could get almost anything here. The arched ceiling rose in the portico high above us, as the light poured in through the colonnades. The market was a labyrinth of stalls and crevices, racks, displays and talking walls, creating a collage of sights and sounds, real and immaterial. I lost her. I was lost here. Wandering in the creation of my own doing. I heard voices in my ears, saw my name <a href="/item10"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a> and eyes looking directly at me. The more I stood still, the more the eyes began to turn on me. The crowd brushed past in every direction, stirring, and churning this human soup. And the more I stood there, the more things seemed to make sense to me. The walls took me back to Puerto Rico, back to Venice and that sleepy little side street off Rue Mouffetard, where I spent a week with the dark haired girl navigating the clubs and cafes. And they knew. There I was, my life on the walls. Standing here, I was bombarded with reminders of the years I’d spent wandering. There was nothing I wanted more than to just get that god damn memory out of the bunny and the walls were trying to speak to me. They were trying to teach me a lesson. Be my friend, be my enemy. Who knew? They wanted me to be something, to be someone. To do something… but all I wanted was this bunny to give up his shit so I could go home, take a bath and rub one out while I still had the energy. I didn’t want to see my sister at the hospital. I didn’t want to have to deal with his body, the arrangements… he should have taken care of it himself. I’m pretty sure he did. He knew it was coming. One thing was for sure, he wasn’t dumb. Which made it even worse. You know, if he was senile… maybe it would have made it better. If he didn’t know what was happening. I hear that rarely happens anymore. There’s so much they can do for that now… but what’s the use. You just go, and you know it. Let me go off into my own head, give me the freedom of ignorance when my time comes and I’ll be happy, but they just keep squeezing in more years, and squeezing out more dollars for every year you’re left here. It began to make sense. Matilda seemed to make sense. God damn sense. Fuck her. Just find your little friend and let’s get out of here. The walls began to close in. The acrid smell of human sweat mixed with perfume seemed to be coming from all over. I began to get anxious as the walls </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="10"> began to show me more. They showed me happy thoughts, could sense my anxiety, they could sense my agitation and began to shift. I know what they were doing. I told someone to make them do it. And here I was… hating every minute of it. The high ceilings seemed to be a mile away, and no way to get out. The colonnade became bars… I could barely make out the light from outside. My eyes had adjusted the dim colors here… and the walls began to speak again. I saw the girl, the dark haired one from Paris. Time slowed and she sparkled. Where’d they get that memory? Where’d they dig that out of? And there it was. She was standing behind words that read ‘Delta.’ They’d stolen her image from my memory and used it to tell me to travel, to get away. Perhaps they knew I wanted to leave… and Matilda’s jacket made sense… that embroidered A… the anarchist. I’d just thought it ironic, but it started to resonate. I look around and I see this place, sparkling and crumbling. A beautiful ruin. It's perfect. I can see the world that I’ve built. "You might have 15 new friends in the area... just wear red on Tuesday and say the magic word, 'Haberdashery' and you're part of something bigger!"... some social algorithm somewhere, or series of them... around every corner, in every thing... they're trying to dictate what life should be all about... they're trying to tell me where to go, who to meet, what to do, what to see, what I might like to read, what I might like to know, what I might like to think, and what I might like to buy. You know what these sort of consumer prediction machines might recommend I buy? A fuck-off machine. It's the technological equivalent of being a pop idol and having a personal bodyguard... they don't just protect you, they don't just create a barrier, they are actively aggressive so that all other parties back down. Brute and with a callous neglect of human dignity. With them, you have that power to push back against a sea of troubles... Help me Fuck-off machine. Help me forward all recommendations to burn for eternity in the fires of Hades. Every recommendation, every targeted ad... anyone looking to know what it is I'm doing is a DDOS <a href="/item11"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a> in the face of sanity. I don't care. I don't need it. I've had my time, and it has left me to my vices... left me for my vices... Time ran away with the good half and left me with sloppy seconds... Who knows, maybe the second course will be better. So those guys, the ones trying to figure all my shit out, trying to tell me who I'm supposed to be through the process of guessing what type of person I might like to become... that's what it's really about isn't it? Who do you want to become? You're not good enough. You need to meet more people, do more things, become more interesting, become smarter, better looking, have more friends, have better friends, have less enemies, have more life experience under your belt... We can help... We're going to get you more money, more happiness, and you're either going to start fucking your girlfriend more because of your newfound confidence, or you’re going to start cheating on your wife because you will realize for the first time in your life, someone other than the person you fell in love with for the sole fact that she loved you unconditionally, might love you just as much and be twice as frisky in the sack. And we can help. All you need to do is buy our shit. It's about this time, you find yourself relaxing, supine, on a park bench, and the words roll out. "Dear Amazon. It has come to my attention that your aggressive attitude towards my own behavior, dependent upon my past decisions, are assumed to be for my best interest. It isn't for a lack of gratitude upon which your gesture brings me great pain, but rather a perceived lack of trust that I hold within myself the ability to rise or fall, fail or conquer. That my own life isn't just the amalgamation of suggested experiences, or a buffet to which I pick-and-choose to taste, but a hunt for fresh meat, warm, bloody, and satisfying. I do not need to be satiated. Let me starve. I do not need to be clothed. Let me freeze. And I know your dark secrets. Do not pretend that your offerings do not come at a price. I reject it. Do not offer me the slavery of others. I reject them. I will take your soul for offering me the souls of others. I will spill your blood for offering </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="11"> me the blood of others. I am not bluffing. I have nothing to lose. We are all guilty and redemption is a myth."</p>
<p>I felt a tap on my shoulder. It was her. Without speaking she handed me a box <a href="/item12"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a> and motioned for me to place the bunny in that box. The box was heavy, covered in some sort of metallic fabric. I placed the bunny box inside.</p>
<p>She spoke. “Phone and wallet,” and waited with her hand held out. I handed them over.</p>
<p>“No shopping sprees.” She didn’t look amused. “What’s this all about?”</p>
<p>She shook her head, and turned to go. I followed. My memories waved goodbye as we headed from the bazaar to the street, and stopped at an old gas powered car. She opened the door, grabbed the box out of my hands, tossed it in and slammed the door. She started to walk away, looking around nervously and I followed. We finally turned the corner and again I asked, “Will you tell me what all this is about?”</p>
<p>“We’ve got to be somewhere public. I know it doesn’t make sense, but it actually works. You duplicate yourself, impersonate yourself <a href="/item13"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a> and you can move around freely. It’s what he’s doing.”</p>
<p>“Your contact?”</p>
<p>“My boyfriend.”</p>
<p>“All this so you can have a make out session with your boyfriend without the bunny spying on you?”</p>
<p>“All this so the bunny doesn’t know who we’re meeting.”</p>
<p>“So you don’t want anyone to know you’re dating this dude because he’s that ugly?”</p>
<p>“Because it would make things unsafe if the two were connected, if the bunny could somehow know what he knew<a href="/item14"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a>. It’s a risk. I’m surprised he agreed to it. But maybe curiosity got the better of him.”</p>
<p>We turned another corner and ducked into a massage parlor.</p>
<p>“I don’t think this is the time for aroma therapy Mati.”</p>
<p>“It’s a private residence. No cameras.” We turned the corner and I followed her down a long hall of doors until we stopped near the end. “Wait here” She entered, and came out a few seconds later. “You’re clean.”</p>
<p>“Clean?”</p>
<p>“Not transmitting. It’s okay. You can relax. This is just an extra precaution. Go ahead.”</p>
<p>I raised my eyebrows and opened the door. I don’t know what I was expecting. Some tattooed hulk with a leather jacket and a bat ready to bash my skull in, or some wigged out junky, too cranked off his ass to complete sentences. But he was just… normal. Skinny guy, with a white t-shirt and jeans. Nothing out of the ordinary. You might find hundreds of him walking the streets of the bazaar right now.</p>
<p>“I’m Omer.” <a href="/item15"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>“Frank.”</p>
<p>“Matilda has told me all about you and your problem.”</p>
<p>“That’s funny, she’s told me nothing about you.” I looked at her with wide eyes.</p>
<p>“Sorry about that, but your problem is a problem for a lot of people… and if it were here, it’d be a problem for us too.”</p>
<p>“I just want the damn memory out of that bunny.” <a href="/item16"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>“Me too. It’s not everyday someone steals an ABA. Those things are worth a lot of money.” </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="12"></p>
<p>“And what’s it worth to you?”</p>
<p>“Just never had my hands on one I guess. But there is just one question. How badly do you want that memory?”</p>
<p>“Pretty bad.”</p>
<p>“I have some good news and some bad news.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead. The good news is that we can get the memory and I know where we can do it.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Now the bad.”</p>
<p>“The bad news is that it’s not an easy thing to do, and we need to do some traveling to get the memory back.”</p>
<p>“How long? How far? I’m supposed to be done with him today.”</p>
<p>“Then you’re out of luck.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“It’s a full days drive, non-stop, maybe less if we take high speed, and then the time for surgery.”</p>
<p>“Surgery? What is this?”</p>
<p>“The ‘B’ in ABA, stands for Biological. Do you see any ports in its head? Have you tried connecting wirelessly? It’s all locked down. If you want to get the memory back, we’re going to need to do surgery. And once we’re in, it’s not as simple as just going in there and copying files. It’s in the bunny’s brain, not the artificial. I’ve only read about this happening. I’ve only read about this sort of thing on deep web <a href="/item17"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a> blogs. I wanted to see it for myself.”</p>
<p>“So what are we supposed to do? I can’t give it back yet. Fuck.”</p>
<p>“It’s your call. You go missing for a few days, steal the bunny for a bit, take him in for surgery and give him back at the end. You’ll be questioned, you’ll be interrogated, you’ll be fined, possibly do a few days in jail, but you’ll have your memory. How much is it worth to you?”</p>
<p>I was going to smash this little fuck’s brain in. Drags me all the way out here just to tell me its impossible. Not impossible, just ridiculous.</p>
<p>“No. I can’t do it. Those memories should be mine. Damn it. They don’t own them. Fuck.”</p>
<p>There was a knock on the door, and we went silent. Matilda cracked the door to find out who it was and the owner stepped in.</p>
<p>“Omer, you have a phone call.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Just a second.”</p>
<p>He left, and I was stuck there in the room with my niece.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry Frank. He didn’t tell me it would be like this. I just wanted to give you a chance.”</p>
<p>“Some chance. It’s alright. I think we’ll just go home. It’s been too much excitement for one day.”</p>
<p>Omer returned, hurried, and nervous.</p>
<p>“Frank. Matilda. It’s time to go.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, we were just deciding to put it to bed.”</p>
<p>“No. I mean, it’s time to leave the city.”</p>
<p>“The city? No. It’s time to go home.”</p>
<p>“The Auditors <a href="/item18"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a> know you’re here. They’ve accused you of stealing the bunny.”</p>
<p>“Auditors? How can you be sure?”</p>
<p>“Someone has to watch the watchers. <a href="/item19"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a> People that… they’re not people, they’re more than human. They can see the flows of information. It was their duty in life. Their call to action. It’s what they signed up for, trained for, and it’s what they were paid to do. It’s why Calico could pay for them to be able to do that. A private contractor, who was built from the ground up to be able to sniff out information. A private contractor who’s employees weren’t just employees, but hitmen, superheros, supervillains, super something’s. They could watch </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="13"> information go, could see what was being passed. They used information as sonar, could see it and understand it like a bat or a dolphin. Echolocation. It was built into them. It was built into their beings to be able to see you, to find you, to watch you consume and to watch you broadcast. They could watch your information, see it encrypted, see it open, they could watch it streaming out. Seemingly slowing down time to watch as it passed by them. Processed at the speed of light. They are out there, searching for us, scanning for our signals, our signature.”</p>
<p>“Can’t I just turn myself in, say it was a misunderstanding? I’m sure it’s fine. No one has complained. We haven’t done anything wrong.”</p>
<p>“It’s too late. Someone wants that bunny, someone wants you, and someone wants us. They know about the two of you, they don’t know about me yet, but I’m sure it’ll happen eventually.”</p>
<p>“This is crazy, we’ve done nothing wrong.”</p>
<p>“But we were planning to, and somehow they figured it out.”</p>
<p>“So now we’re fugitives?”</p>
<p>“Now YOU’RE a fugitive. She’s an accomplice, and I’ll be one soon.”</p>
<p>“Frank. He’s right. We’ve got to go. These people aren’t the people to mess with. They will with you what they want to do with you. There is no tolerance. If they say you are wanted, you are wanted. We are wanted.”</p>
<p>“We are wanted? We are wanted? All I ever wanted was that god damn bunny’s dreams… and look at this. No, there’s got to be another way.”</p>
<p>“Right now, there’s the back door.”</p>
<p>“She’s right.”</p>
<p>“Until we find a better way, we’re fugitives.”</p>
<p>“Just like that?”</p>
<p>“Just like that.”</p>
<p>“I should have never listened to you.”</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t have listened to me? I shouldn’t have listened to you! You’re the one so determined to see that bunny give up his shit. Dude, face it. The past is the past… now our future’s fucked.”</p>
<p>“So what do we do? Well, we can lay low for a while until they catch us and rot in prison until we die… no, it’s probably not that bad. But here’s the thing. Now that we’re fugitives, let’s just get the bunny’s dreams off there for you. You ready?”</p>
<p>“No. Not really. But fuck it.”</p>
<p>It looks like I mistook opportunity for misfortune, and it took the day and turned it to hell. My sister was going to kill me. I’d made a criminal out of her daughter in a matter of minutes… well, by the sound of it, she was probably already half way down the corridor of broken dreams dealing with some shady shit, so it was only a matter of time I guess… but it’s just not the sort of thing you want to do to blood.</p>
<p>Omer stepped forward. “The auditors are going to be here in a matter of minutes. It’s time to go. Maybe we can figure something out, claim it was an accident, claim ignorance. But we don’t know if we’re really being charged with any crime yet.”</p>
<p>“So you have a way out of here?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. We’ve got to go through the tunnels.”</p>
<p>It was the subway and train tunnels, the old, dark thoroughfares of subterranean transit.</p>
<p>“It’s not completely safe, but we can get to a few places, lose them. We’ll be picked back up when we get out of the tunnels so we’ll have to throw off our scent.”</p>
<p>Throw off our scent. It’s strange how quickly you can go from being a guy with a problem, </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="14"> to a guy who’s on some kind of secret list. I’d never be off that list. Once you’re on, you’re on for good.</p>
<p>Omer grabbed the bunny from the other room and we followed him down the corridor until the very end. We headed into a broom closet with an old grate floor.</p>
<p>“It’s in here. We have to go down.”</p>
<p>He pulled back a rubber mat and revealed a heavy steal door with an old circular combination lock on it. He knew the combination, and preyed open the latch to reveal a staircase leading underground.</p>
<p>“This used to be a transit maintenance facility until this line got shut down after the floods. They moved the equipment but left the access. After you.” It was dark, the only light came from the dull red glow from the emergency lights spaced out along the passage ways. I guess they left them on just in case. They hummed with electricity, sounding feeble and unsure, as if they could burst or fail at any moment. Omer shut the doors behind us and went up ahead. Matilda grabbed him by the hand and I followed behind. My jacket and tie weren’t used to being underground.</p>
<p>“Here, you take the bunny.” Omer handed me the box. “Don’t let him out of there or all this sneaking around will be in jest.”</p>
<p>We walked along these small corridors until we came to the main tunnel. Omer seemed to know where he was going. He pulled a small light from his pocket once we reached the main tunnel. The red emergency lights had all but been forgotten and the tunnel empty and cold without them. Our footsteps echoed as the gravel under our feet slid, the dirt sliding between our shoes and the concrete. Over trash, leaves, papers, remnants of when this place used to have life in it. We hurried. Omer seemed nervous. We’d come across trash that was new, days, or weeks old, and food scraps gnawed at by small rodents. There were people living down here. It took us about two miles of walking but there was finally a dash of light in the distance, casting slight shadows on the walls and ground beneath me. We stopped.</p>
<p>“Here’s where we have to change.”</p>
<p>Omer took a sharp turn down a small hallway on the left of the tunnel and stopped at an electrical box. He pulled a key from his pocket and unlocked the box, pulling old jackets and clothes for us to wear. “You’ll have to put these on to look different. There’s hats in here and a face mask to keep them off you. There’s cameras at the entrance. <a href="/item20"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a><a href="/item21"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>“You two leave from here. The three of us can’t be seen together.”</p>
<p>“Where will we meet you?” I asked.</p>
<p>He turned to Matilda, “You know where we met last? We can’t go to the studio, they’ll be watching it. Meet me at the bank. I’ll bring a mobile kit. They may still think you’re in the bazaar, and they don’t know I’m with you.”</p>
<p>We split up. Matilda and I exited the tunnel and Omer split off back into the darkness. “You know where we’re going?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s his place.”</p>
<p>“You sure we’ll be safe?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. It depends how bad they want you. I don’t know why they want it so bad… that bunny. Seems like a waste of time and energy to me.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for doing this. I’m sorry I got you into it.”</p>
<p>“It would have happened eventually.”</p>
<p>There’s nothing that I could do or say to make her understand how much I wished she wasn’t a part of it. I guess she wasn’t. She didn’t steal the bunny. I did. But who knows what was going on behind the scenes, who was added to the database and in what capacity. </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="15"></p>
<p>“Keep your head low and keep the mask on until we’re there.”</p>
<p>“Where are we going?”</p>
<p>“To the bank.”</p>
<p>You’d never know it, but the only places that seemed to be available to meet in the city, free of surveillance, were the uninhabited, the old, the broken down and forgotten places. If it’s known, it will be known to many. The forgotten, the underground, underappreciated and desolate places… those seemed to be the respite places for these two. There was a way about them, an unspoken language that kept them going. They rarely spoke to each other. It seemed to be through eye contact and glances that they passed any information at all. We walked and walked. I wanted to ask her questions, but I couldn’t. I was getting the sense that she didn’t talk openly about these things in public. We were hidden for the moment, unknown but suspicious blips. Two fake derelicts. With her, there was always paranoia. There was always suspicion. She didn’t know if we were being watched. She didn’t know that we were safe. There was no way to know, one way or the other. I suppose the only way to know is to intercept a message, to hear what they hear, to see what they see. It was the problem with her, she had no way to prove or disprove any of this… but it could only be assumed that you were always at risk. You could only assume that there was someone out there with eyes on you, following you, listening to you, recording your footsteps, watching your movements, analyzing your actions, predicting what you might do next. I tried to predict people’s behaviors. <a href="/item22"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a> It’s what I did for a living. I tried to predict what they were, who they were, who they wanted to be, and supplied them with the access to be able to do just that. It wasn’t just with my client’s products that I could get them to do things. It was their own memories, their own being that made them want to either stay the same, or change. It was the things that they loved about themselves, or wanted to change about themselves that we sought. And we could tell. We could tell when someone wanted a change, or was making a change. Their habits changed. That 95% accuracy changed. It would change every now and again, every few years with each person, with the changing tides of life… but these too were expected. The seven year itch is a real thing, and we can predict when it’s coming. We can see by the language they use whether they’re happy or not in their relationships, in their jobs, in their lives. We know when someone will be looking for something different. And it isn’t surprising that there are new acquaintances made at these junctures as well. It depends, really, what type of person you are, if you’re going to be doing something different tomorrow than what you’re doing today. I guess I stopped following my own pattern today. I guess by dropping off the map, I’ve gone ahead and marked myself for more scrutiny. That’s when they are really interested. The part about following people, about knowing their habits and trends… that’s boring. To people like me, who can look at a person, a group of 10, 20, 100, 10,000 or 1,000,000 and tell what is going to happen with them, the prediction part gets boring after a while. You just get good at it, and we have interns who can go through piles of data with sorting algorithms they’ve developed themselves and just tell us… up, down, left, right, red shoes on Tuesday, extra spicy in September. It’s just not too interesting. Once we know the data, once we know the trend it’s just a matter of keeping things going. It’s just a matter of keeping the shoppers shopping. But when there’s a change, when the trickle of shifts starts to happen and the first fluctuation marks a sea change, then we’ve got something to work with.</p>
<p>We arrived at the bank, <a href="/item23"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a> and old building on the corner of forgotten and unused. A large chain and key lock held the doors shut, but she had the key. She didn’t look over her shoulder, just pushed through and led us inside as if it were second nature.</p>
<p>Once inside she turned and spoke, “Don’t touch anything.” </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="16"></p>
<p>The place was grand, high ceilings, columns, a large grandfather clock placed high in the center of the rear wall, the windows boarded shut cast slivers of light across the floor. We walked through to the back, past the teller stations, and waited outside the vault on a plastic mat.</p>
<p>I tried to add a little levity to the situation. “It’s nice. Could use some dusting, but I like it.”</p>
<p>Matilda looked at me confused. Didn’t know if she thought it was funny, dumb, or just inappropriate. It was always hard to tell with her. “Thanks for doing this. I’m sorry you got dragged in like this. It might not be that bad.”</p>
<p>“It’s that bad. But we need to figure out why.”</p>
<p>“How can we do that?”</p>
<p>“The bunny should have some information. We’ll need to know more.”</p>
<p>I could only assume that she knew what she was talking about. She got a message from Omer and we waited in silence for him to arrive. The place echoed with each shuffle of the feet. I leaned back against the wall to relax for a minute. “I said don’t touch anything.” She glared at me.</p>
<p>“Whatever you say.”</p>
<p>We heard talking outside. She grabbed me and pulled me down below the teller’s desk. It grew louder as they came near the door. The cracks in the boards on the front door shuttered and the light flickered as bodies passed by. We waited. There wasn’t much we could do except wait in silence as the talking grew louder, muffled and unclear, but the door stayed shut, the lock remained. Matilda just sat, legs crossed, waiting calmly as if this was a regular occurrence. I tried to stay calm as I stayed silent focusing on the voices. Then, as quickly as they came they went. It was silent. We listened for signs of life outside the door but there was nothing. Minutes passed and we stayed huddled and silent. She was the first to move, lifting herself onto her feet as she looked, eyes fixed on the door. I stood up and watched. There was nothing, no movement, no noise… it seemed safe. “You do this often? Hiding and ducking into dark corners?”</p>
<p>“On occasion.”</p>
<p>“Does your mother know?”</p>
<p>“Do you think she knows? And if she did, do you think I’d ever be allowed outside the house?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, she’d freak out if she knew about all this.”</p>
<p>“What she doesn’t know won’t hurt her.”</p>
<p>“If you end up in jail, it will. I don’t know that she can handle losing a father and daughter in one weekend.”</p>
<p>“Really? You’re going to lecture me?</p>
<p>“Maybe you can go back. I’ll say I kidnapped you.”</p>
<p>“Maybe that’s not such a bad id…”</p>
<p>The chain rattled and the door swung open. We dropped down behind the counter again and listened. The door slammed shut and footsteps crossed the room to us. It was Omer. “You scared the shit out of us.” Matilda rose and hugged him.</p>
<p>“You two okay? I had to wait out there for a while. Some kind of drug deal right outside the door.”</p>
<p>“We’re fine. What do you need from us? From the bunny?”</p>
<p>He pulled three white painters suits from the duffle bag. “First, put these on. We can’t go leaving DNA around.” <a href="/item24"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a>We changed on the plastic mat and he wrapped our coats and clothes in it, and headed into the vault. A card table and a few folding chairs sat at the center. Nothing else. He closed the door behind us. “This vault won’t let the ABA communicate. Now, let’s see that bunny.” I pulled the bunny from the box and placed him on the table. </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="17"></p>
<p>The bunny looked up, head cocked, and spoke. “Frank. I really don’t appreciate being stuffed in there this whole time. What are you up to?”</p>
<p>“Just trying to find out all your mysteries.”</p>
<p>“My mysteries? Who is the other male?</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about me,” Omer spoke to the bunny.</p>
<p>“I don’t know who you are, but that looks like Matilda. I recognize her from Steven’s pictures.”</p>
<p>“Well, I should have expected that.” Matilda looked to Omer for reassurance and he could only shrug his shoulders.</p>
<p>“I’ve got something for you to wear.” Omer pulled out some black fabric and a collar from his bag, set them on the table and began to check his phone. <a href="/item25"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>“He’s transmitting now, I’ve found his signal. Matilda, can you hold him for me?”</p>
<p>“What have you got there?” Again, Toki cocked his head inquisitively.</p>
<p>“This will be good for you. We won’t have to keep you in that box the whole time.” Matilda held him down as Omer placed the fabric over the bunny’s head and snapped it into place. It had cutouts for the ears, eyes, and mouth. “This collar will do as well.” He placed the collar around his neck, and checked his phone again. “Nothing. He’s not transmitting. The fabric and the collar disrupt the signal. He won’t be able to communicate anymore. You don’t have to stay in that dark little box anymore, okay?” <a href="/item26"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>“Thank you, but I really need to be able to communicate. Could you please take them off?”</p>
<p>“Not for a while… They’re staying on.”</p>
<p>“Frank, would you take them off me? I’m not supposed to be wearing these.”</p>
<p>“Sorry buddy, they’re staying on.”</p>
<p>Omer leaned down to the bunny. “Now, Toki. You like to be called Toki?”</p>
<p>“Yes, unidentified male, you can call me Toki.”</p>
<p>“Call me Peter.”</p>
<p>“Okay, Peter.”</p>
<p>“Toki, I want you to replay the memory that you showed Frank.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know how.”</p>
<p>“You don’t know how?”</p>
<p>“It’s in my imagination, and I don’t know how to get it.”</p>
<p>“Do you remember showing Frank the memory?”</p>
<p>“I remember showing him something, but I don’t know what I showed him.”</p>
<p>“Do you remember what it felt like when you were showing him the memory?”</p>
<p>“It felt strange, I was tired.”</p>
<p>“Okay, what I want you to do, is think of how you felt when you showed Frank that memory. I want you to try to get yourself back to that place.”</p>
<p>“Frank, would you like me to do this?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Toki. Please try.”</p>
<p>“Alright Frank.”</p>
<p>The bunny’s eyes began to look heavy, sleepy. Matilda and I looked to Omer as if he knew what was going on but he shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>“I’ve only read about this. I don’t really know how it works.” <a href="/item27"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>The bunny began to relax, resting on his haunches, staying still, his eyes blinked, as he appeared to start to doze off. They were almost closed, he looked to be just on the cusp of sleep when they lit up. A scene appeared on the wall, it was my father, in his home, checking notes, writing, watching commercials, watching media. He’d go back and forth, writing notes on paper, </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="18"> watching the screen, taking notes about what he was seeing. We couldn’t see what was being written, but it was something. Omer started recording this with his phone. I watched a man I had come to lose, seem to lose himself in front of that screen. He was looking for something, waiting intently for clues on the screen. When he’d see one, he’d jot it down. It looked almost normal. He often wrote notes to himself. He was always writing something down, so this didn’t seem that out of the ordinary, but there was something about this, that just seemed a little bit off. He seemed to be waiting for something on the screen, like looking for clues.</p>
<p>“What is it?” I looked to Omer.</p>
<p>“Wait.” He watched the wall, the projection as if transfixed, he didn’t want to miss a moment.</p>
<p>We watched as my father wrote the notes but we couldn’t see what he was writing. Then, the bunny, played another, and another of just my father watching the screen, writing notes, decoding something. We couldn’t see what he was writing. We saw through Toki’s eyes, and Steven was keeping them hidden from the bunny, but he slipped up, dropped his pad and we could see for a moment. It was hard to make out what was written and as quickly as we could see, it was over. Light dimmed and Toki began to awake from his dream. Omer stopped recording.</p>
<p>For a moment, I got to see a glimpse of his life… a glimpse into what I’d been ostracized from… his life. There, on the walls of that vault, he lived again. As quickly as the light appeared, it was gone, and we were left with only questions.</p>
<p>“Do you still want me to try to find the memories?”</p>
<p>Matilda spoke, “You haven’t found them yet?”</p>
<p>“No Matilda, I don’t know if I can.”</p>
<p>“He doesn’t remember. There’s something else going on in there that the pilot doesn’t know about.”</p>
<p>Omer watched the screen of his phone and paused as my father dropped the pad… he</p>
<p>signaled to Matilda and I and we left the vault, leaving Toki inside.</p>
<p>“I think your father may have been involved in something. Something he obviously didn’t want the bunny to know about.”</p>
<p>“Like what? He was an old man.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. He was writing numbers… some coded information, but whatever it is, it’s valuable.”</p>
<p>“You think that’s why we’ve been targeted?”</p>
<p>“I just don’t know, but it’s possible.”</p>
<p>“So now what?”</p>
<p>“The only way to know is to get the rest of the memory out of that bunny. We have to do it quickly, and we have to do it someplace safe. I can’t get us all the way there, but I can get us close. “</p>
<p>“You can get us close?”</p>
<p>“We’ll need to leave the city. We can take my car.”</p>
<p>We left the bank, and made our way on foot through the streets. We had… It was getting dark. I hadn’t checked my messages, or talked to my sister. I needed to get in touch with her, let her know I hadn’t kidnapped her daughter. Perhaps I had. There was room for misinterpretation. There was room now for me to turn back, to head home and give the four legged fragmented memory of my father back to the rightful owners. I was at the point between anxious and exhausted, and rationalizing this journey took balancing the fear of consequence and justification through a bereaved act of temporary insanity. If I turned back now there might be the chance to save the girl, to hide the boy, and to just keep on living. To plead my case to the auditors, </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="19"> fake a confession to the bunny itself in confidence, knowing it’d be used as evidence of my actions. But it was all being recorded. The bunny knew we kidnapped it, stuffed it in a box and forced him to play back the memory. There was no way around it. We stole the bunny, kidnapped the little guy in hopes of breaking into its subconscious to steal something of questionable value. It wasn’t questionable to me. It was the memory of someone I loved and had grown removed from. I was blood, not the bunny, not the auditors, not the ones who made and manufactured what went on inside its head. He was both a burden and a fundamental constituent of passage. At the end of this journey, then what? If we do get the memory from his head, if I do get what I want, what’s to come of Toki? At that point, we can’t go giving him back. The options seemed to be growing smaller by the second. So we walked. A kidnapper, two teens and an insubordinate hard drive shaped like a rabbit. I couldn’t imagine what was going on in my sister’s head. Her daughter and brother had gone missing the day after her father passes. She had to know we were safe. Surely there was a way to contact her and let her know she didn’t need to worry. “Is there anyway we can contact your mother, tell her we’re alright?”</p>
<p>The two of them looked at each other. Omer exhaled as he thought. “If you’re worried about phone calls and being linked to us we can find another way. There might not be a simple way. Fuck, even a carrier pigeon would do. Something. Hand a kid on a bike a note, 20 bucks, and directions and tell him to deliver the damn thing.”</p>
<p>We got to Omer’s after dark and headed out. He had an old jeep, ran on gas and had little in the way of amenities. ‘Dumb Tech’ they called it. <a href="/item28"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>As we drove, the radio played and we listened to the president speak. She was eloquent, young and in control of this place. Omer turned the radio up when she came on. <a href="/item29"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a><a href="/item30"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>


<p>PART III</p>
<p>Swallow Hard</p>
<p>The city exchanged high rises and bright lights for long stretches of trees and rolling hills as the distance between exits grew. Small towns popped up in valleys and alongside rivers, disappearing into the forests as we drove on, smaller and smaller each time. What was it about these places that made them desirable to live in? They had their own secrets, their own governments, their own worlds built right in. A little oasis would pop up on the side of the highway and you’d wonder what it was that was happening there. It wasn’t the type of place I’d want to be. The city had everything, but it was exhausting. In a time like this, maybe it would be better to come here, to get away from all the madness. To get away from this little bunny, from the bright lights, busy streets and barrage of my own hands, the worlds that we once had, fed back to us, as memories of persuasion. Somehow, I wanted there to be a shortcut to the memory. Some were so easy, so accessible, so incredibly useful. They normally made my life easier. They normally made my clients happy, and the customers more likely to do something. This memory, the one riding in the car, was not that exactly. It was the memory of persuasion to become a felon, to become a kidnapper and a derelict, riding shotgun in a teenager’s car you barely know so we can tear the temporal cortex from this bunny and push some explicit, episodic memory into some database so I can watch it from the comfort of my own home. Matilda leaned in from the back seat as I tried to rest my eyes. I’d barely slept the night before and I was handing my future to these two people I barely knew. She was the niece I never knew. Aloof and precocious, never speaking too much, never giving away feelings, her wants and desires. She was a mystery to some extent. I think to me as well as her own family. She wasn’t the type of person that </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="20"> would just go on doing something for the sake of doing it. She needed a reason. It was the mystery of the bunny, perhaps, that held her interest, that drove her with us out here, in this car, into the middle of nowhere, so that we could head farther into the middle of nowhere, so that we could become criminals. The thought was ridiculous. All I really wanted was a soft bosom to lay my head into, to fall asleep on. As I closed my eyes to drift off I could see her. She was sitting with me on an old rock fence when we were teens. The one with dark hair. The one from the bazaar. She smiled and I drifted deeper.</p>
<p>The day the plane fell from the sky, I thought the world would change forever. But it didn't. The thunder cried first, the sound of engines somewhere distant growing nearer, then it stopped, receded, in its place the street and the sirens returned. It broke through clouds drifting down from the sky, falling softly in a low whisper as it slid into the buildings. The wings passed through brick, mortar, glass and steel, shattering lives and voices, spraying debris into the air. I turned my body to shield my niece from the blast. From the rooftop I could watch. I though it would change the world forever. I thought it meant planes everywhere would start falling from the sky, that the layer of eyes above us would come crashing, burning through the atmosphere... I thought it was the start of the rain, the rain of our past looking to predict our future... how long had they been up there... above us, watching over us, giving us guidance, a muse in our ears, showing us the way home. It must be strange to be up there, hovering above. But they fall sometimes... this one, banished from the heavens, sent down to live here, had wronged the all-knowing entity. I wonder what its like to watch others come plummeting down? I wonder what it's like to watch the world see you in you naked... the king... that once was... that isn't anymore... fallen. A tragedy... I want to say it would be okay to take pity on him. To take pity on the one that was cast out. He is the eyes of the entity, he sees what the entity sees, knows what the entity knows. The fallen wants you to be free from the musings of the entity, to make your choices, that could lead you to live in the world in a way the entity did not intend... what would the world be like? What is the intention of the entity? How do you know what choices are yours and what choices are not yours? It is life's interface... it only allows for certain choices... only allows certain options... but what if there were a different interface, or if you chose to play as a different player? The interface would have to be flexible... the interface for interacting with life would have to be different. There are signs that the interface is malleable.... it is the mirror... it is the way that others see you... in the wake of... unfinished thoughts... the interface for life... we would be like drooling chimpanzees compared to the fallen... sliding through these buildings. It’s funny, how evil they make it out to be... how corrupt they make the story out to be. The sounds from heaven don’t abide by the rules of our eyes and ears, commenting on our lives when the light glows and the shadows recede to reveal the detail of the day. These flying angels sing at any hour, see at any time of day, but they are fallible. They can fall as this one did. They need maintenance, and love, prisoners and pioneers. Journeying to the reaches of the earth, capturing the world below. They make no judgment, just eyes and ears of the entity, guided by the voice of the entity itself. With a single switch, they fall, a misinstruction, a new voice, false or foreign. Inaccessible immigrants to the landscapes below. <a href="/item31"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>I awoke, the pines lit from the headlights as we drove. We stopped for coffee. I paid with cash, a rare form of payment nowadays. Few places accepted it. The three of us leaned against the car. The plan was to find the Mechanic. An old friend of Omer’s.</p>
<p>“You sure he's going to be there?”</p>
<p>“I don't know. As best I can tell, he's going to be there.”</p>
<p>“What makes you so sure? When was the last time you talked?” </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="21"></p>
<p>“Two years.”</p>
<p>“Two years?”</p>
<p>“Two years.” There was a silence in the lot as the uncertainty hit us. My niece turned and made eye contact with Omer.</p>
<p>“He'll be there.”</p>
<p>“I’ll drive the rest of the way.”</p>
<p>“Just a few more hours.”</p>
<p>We were headed to the Shitty City <a href="/item32"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a> as they called it. It was the type of place that used to be great. Old Victorian houses lined the streets, crumbling and decaying as they swapped tenants year over year. Industry had left long ago, leaving an unsure future in its path. To the north were the rich. The suburbs of people that had businesses, did business inside and outside the city and maintained the normalcy of everyday suburban life. To the east and west there was farmland, orchards and hills. The south was downtown. A few square blocks of a city that had, many times over, tried to revitalize itself. It worked for a bit. For a few years there would be a celebration of the rebirth, and the swings of the economy would slow it back down. People would concede to leaving as the crowds from the south side of the city grew even more populated. Vanity and despair leapfrogged as the tenants looked for some kind of respite from a future that wasn’t going to come bearing fruits and gifts. This is where we were heading. The sun was starting to rise behind the pines as we got close, and the city emerged, silhouetted against the sky. My niece had her feet up on the dash as she rested, head leaned against the window, staring out with the bunny on her lap. Omer was in the back seat, sleeping. We were running out of time and hedging our bets on an ex-con who may or may not still be working as a mechanic at a garage.</p>
<p>We passed beneath exits as we entered into the heart of the city, the highway splitting north from south as we headed west. The sun was rising. The traffic was light, easy driving at this time of day. Just a few travelers, on some journey like us, or up for an early job. Maybe they’d been driving all night. I reached my hand back to Omer and give him a shake on the leg. We were looking for exit 79, we were getting close and he knew where to go. The man in the mirror told me to want sleep. To want to pull over and find a bed to rest in. The man in the mirror told me stop this drive, to turn back and release us from the crusade. The eyes pleaded for respite, pleaded to have the world turn easy and give me answers but I didn’t want him to win. I could walk through the halls of the mall, be handed my own thoughts and dreams on a platter, be handed my own wants and aspirations as easy as it would be to look at me and determine that my receding hairline was coming with a splash of salt and pepper. At this point, I could easily have that reversed. There wasn’t much you couldn’t get done. And that’s what’s fucked up about my father. He could have lived another 20 years. <a href="/item33"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a>That’s what I thought the bunny was doing there. I thought he was there to take care of him, to let me know that he wasn’t taking care of himself. I thought he was there to make sure the blood didn’t spike, to make sure the body was functioning properly, to get him the help he needed when he needed it. Where was he when the stroke came on? He should have been there. He should have been watching the symptoms for the last 15 years. That’s what he was made to do. I don’t know why he just let him go like that. If anything, the bunny was defective. A malformed ABA guilty of workplace incompetence and medical malpractice. If I don’t go to jail I’m suing the shit out of them for keeping this ABA out there, knowing that he wasn’t doing his job. Calico must have known. They must have seen it coming. When the big doctor in the sky checks on a patient, it doesn’t ignore the weak, the old, the miscared for. It reaches out, makes calls, allocates medicine and drugs so that those out </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="22"> there that need it, can get it. Whatever it was doing, it was skipping over him. Something had them fooled. When this is over and we are able to get the memory back, I’m ending the bunny. He’ll make a fine stew.</p>
<pre>
<code>Omer started to wake up, rubbing his eyes with his hands, the blanket coving his upper body and torso leaving the tips of his jeans and dirty white socks exposed. I was really trusting my niece with this pilgrimage. She was doing all this for a person she barely knew, a person whose lifestyle she adamantly opposed. Maybe she’d just given up and hoped this was something to redeem the hiding and lies. It was easy to see the relentless assault the persuasive memories had taken on people, bringing up memories you wanted to forget, of people that you missed. They were built of emotions that you might not know existed. But we were careful to pick from the ones that seemed least harmful. Unless there’s something we didn’t know, and sometimes that was the case. We never showed exes while significant others were around, and after marriage the use of exes become increasingly sparing. Maybe if we caught a glimpse that someone was in a good mood, or was stalking their own memories from a distance, then we’d bring it up again. Usually the memories we deliver, are the memories used or accessed recently. Usually they are the images that have shown up during recent spikes of pleasure. So we focus on those mainly. In some rare occasions, if some left over bit of information about someone is the only recorded key to a specific emotion, we’ll trigger it. Although risky, sometimes we are looking for that one, specific trigger. In the same way that a scent can bring you back to a person, place, or distant memory, we look to cook up a concoction of visuals that do the same thing. It’s only that we’ve been knowing about your reaction to those images for some time that we can pick today’s visual, persuasive fragrance. I suppose being that young at just 22 you’ve got some memories, but mostly it’s during the time stepping into those years that we pull some very relevant and persuasive memories. So, if you’re there, having just grown out of an awkward stage, having just exited either some of the greatest, or worst periods in your life, it’s thrust right back at you. It can be jarring. We tend to have a hard time using memories on people during their early 20s that are from anything other than their early childhood. It might be young loves first encounter that we pull from, but even that’s hard. It’s hard to tell with them how they’ll react to their crushes during that time. Some get over them, so don’t. Some reminisce about the good times, some wish they’d never happened. Its easier to use the positive experiences, but people go through some incredible transformations during that period that sometimes you don’t want to be reminded of the person you were five minutes ago, let alone five years ago. That’s the trouble, that’s the trick, knowing what they’ll like about themselves from five minutes ago, and trying to predict what they’ll like about themselves five minutes from now. It’s the parts that they don’t like about themselves that are easy. You don’t necessarily show someone with pimples and oily skin, unless you’re in the makeup section, but even that is too transparent. You want to do it subtly, just leading up to the purchase in the makeup section, maybe a few days, or hours before, if you can predict when someone is going to go through the makeup aisle. That’s why it’s important to know the routine and habits. If you know them, you can pinpoint the place where it’s best for your subject to relive something. That’s the fun part. When you get good at showing people what they need to see, to influence what they’ll be doing in the next few hours, based on their past behavior, you know you’ve done your job. I was good at my job. 
As he awoke, he stretched, and looked out over the city, eyes adjusting to the morning sun. Toki perked up. Watching him wake. 
</code>
</pre>
<p>“Don’t look at me.”</p>
<p>Toki looked to me and I shook my head. He put his head down on Matilda’s lap. </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="23"></p>
<p>“So, what’s with you and this mechanic?”</p>
<p>“He’s an old friend I guess.”</p>
<p>“You knew him well?”</p>
<p>“I grew to know him.”</p>
<p>“At the garage?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I guess it was at the garage. When I started, I guess we were a little skeptical of each other. I didn’t know much about his past, nor did he know much about mine.”</p>
<p>“Close in age?”</p>
<p>“He’s older.”</p>
<p>“So what makes you think he can help?”</p>
<p>“He used to smuggle stuff.”</p>
<p>“And what makes you think he’ll help us?”</p>
<p>“I helped him.”</p>
<p>“Helped him?”</p>
<p>“He needed to do more business than he was doing. I showed him a few tricks to get around a some legal issues he was having.”</p>
<p>“Legal?”</p>
<p>“His P.O. kept a good eye on him.”</p>
<p>“So he’s familiar with getting caught.”</p>
<p>“And not getting caught. I can’t say he’s the most admirable person alive, but he takes care of his own. Takes care of his friends, even if it’s done in some twisted way. Even if it means hurting someone else to protect them.”</p>
<p>The kid looked out the window for a minute. Thinking, I guess. I could see him in some far off place.</p>
<p>“It took us a while but we got to know each other. He’d talk about his childhood, about the people that took care of him, who taught him to protect himself. ‘My brother,’ he’d say, ‘he told me one day 'He can't do that to you. You need to teach him a lesson. You burn his house down.'” I don’t remember what he did exactly, beat him up as kid, I think this guy hurt some people… real bad. So he did the same back. ‘So I did. I got a gallon of gasoline and lit his house up. I was a kid. That's what we did." His name is Al. He smiled as he told the story, as if it were one of his fondest memories. Right or wrong didn't seem to be an issue. It was wrong, whatever was done to him, so this seemed only natural. Burning someone's house down isn't something that leaves you easily. It stays with you, obviously, and at 40, he kept it close, one of those memories that follows you, you know? That has shaped you, has led you to where you are. It led him all over. Jail, I guess. Drugs. Theft. Never arson though. Never got caught for that one. I think that was a one-time deal. He wasn’t alone in it. One thing leads to another... one path leads another... some paths seem to lead to the same path... similar paths... similar outcomes... partly cloudy with a chance of incarceration... all for a swell of child misdemeanors... but they're on the watch list from early on. That’s where he was. On the list. Watched by his P.O. So now, as a grown man, what's he going to do? He's got a life. He didn’t want to be on the run forever. According to his P.O., he's supposed to be home by 11. So we get close, after months of being under cars, after burning forearms on manifolds, bloody knuckles and oil stained clothes. So one day it’s my birthday and we go out. I’m like, ‘Fuck it, it's my birthday, and we're going out for drinks and tits.’ He wanted to go out, to share in my youth. ‘I'm a grown man. I don’t need to tell him everywhere I go.’ He was a hustler. Always working, always going, always in the 'on' position. Even at night he'd drive me by his sister's place to talk to her about a new business. </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="24"></p>
<p>People were always asking me to help them with their problems, to help launch whatever it was... in this case a trading card business... she wanted to get into selling rare trading cards. You can still find some floating around. People collect them. I used to be into that as a kid, but hadn’t thought about it in a few years. I helped out a little bit, in finding some, pointing her in the right direction. Whatever the scheme was, it was something to help them get out of whatever kind of life it was. Every little job helped. Every little scheme helped. There was no set path I guess. There were no road signs that pointed to success… only schemes to help get a little more, a little at a time. So, that night, that was the first time I was asked for business advice. The advice Al needed wasn't strictly business. He was taking me out to a seedy little place. We smoked before the club. Drank before the club. We got there and I was already half gone. It was my birthday. Not a bad one at that. I was mesmerized by the dancers. I watched them grind their hips... one in particular caught my attention. I liked watching them dance, but there was something else I enjoyed more. It’s funny, I liked watching them dress afterward. I liked to watch them in that intimate moment when the act was over and they were real, you know? I liked to watch them in their element, naked and vulnerable, in front a crowd that had lost attention at the last flick of hair that ended with the music. When the grins subsided from the audience and the music was replaced by soft conversations and clicking glasses, this is when I took notice. That moment of intimacy, the one you weren't suppose to notice was the interesting one, that moment when she walked to the edge of the stage, unhooked her clothes from the rack and began to dress. I felt as if I were in her bedroom, a fly on the wall, watching her in her own home. According to social norms I wasn't supposed to find that sexy... that wasn't suppose to be the show. You don't throw dollars when she puts her clothes back on. But that’s where the real show was. I took notice. She caught my eye watching her in that moment. She knew I was watching. She came over, sat on my lap, and asked how I knew my friend. We looked like an odd couple. A young, skinny kid, with a grizzled ex-con. ‘We work together, it's my birthday.’ I don’t think she believed my story, but offered me a private dance. I don’t know, I was still high and a little drunk. My mind was wandering... from the girl I had just broken up with. I thought I'd like the dance... We got into a private booth. She danced well, but I stopped her half way through. ‘Are you from Life Savers?’ I didn’t know what Life Savers was, but I imagine it was some kind of outreach program, or a name given to patrons that want to rehabilitate or save girls from this life. I wasn’t. I really didn’t think anything I could say would change her life. She was older. Maybe in her mid 40s. Great body. She was sexy. But I wasn’t there to save her life, instead I asked her about herself. She told me about a business she was starting, selling lingerie, asked for advice. Second time that day. I didn't really have any. She told me about her daughter. And, seeing her here, mostly naked after the show had ended, talking about her personal life, it seemed more intimate. I paid her, tipped her well. She seemed interested. I wasn't looking for anything. She seemed like she just wanted someone to talk to. It was good I suppose. Al just watched me with her, enjoying ourselves. He nodded. It was then that I thought about the watching, the seeing, the onlookers. I wondered what the onlookers look for? Would they like to be able to interact? I wondered what it would be like... I wonder what they dream of. Do the onlookers dream at all? Do they dream of catastrophe or daisies? It's easy to want to know what's going on in their heads as they stare back at you through those black, lifeless eyes, like the eyes of a barnyard animal that stands motionless... emotionless. ‘Eyes into hell,’ maybe some paranoid, incompetent hell. Eyes into the souls of the terrified. I don't know though. Maybe they just like to watch. Jerking off somewhere over the ability to just sit and watch, and to watch us worry all the while about what goes on behind those eyes. It's funny... why worry about the lifeless black eyes in here? The watchers watching watchers... </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="25"> the lives of others more interesting than yours. A cold, endless, lifeless war on terror through a blackness that gives nothing back. A permanent poker face. Do you have the king, a queen, the ace of spades, a full house, or are you sitting back with a pair of deuces watching us all sweat it out? Don’t get me wrong, there’s something very real about what goes on behind the eyes, but you just don’t know. That’s where all the extra precaution comes from. That’s why I do what I do. Why that bunny is so dangerous, that’s why the mechanic will help. For him, those black eyes mean a lot. He’s got a lot to lose, and he’s on the list. He knows it, his P.O. knows it, and he’s got a lot of pride in helping the people he cares about.”</p>
<pre>
<code>It was about 7 am when we pulled up to the garage. It was off the main boulevard, just past a pancake house and before an ABA DIY grooming salon. An old truck sat in the lot. 
</code>
</pre>
<p>“That’s his. He’s here.”</p>
<p>Matilda had started to wake up. Toki had perked up. She fed him some nuts and celery from her bag as we parked. Omer got out of the backseat, stretching in the morning light. I followed.</p>
<p>“Give me a minute.”</p>
<p>He disappeared into the garage. One bay door was open, the other closed. It must have just opened. I smelled a puff of smoke as the mechanic came around the building. He stood there a second, cigarette hanging from his lower lip, took a drag and approached us.</p>
<p>“Can I help you young man?”</p>
<p>“I hope so.” <a href="/item34"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>He stood at just about 6 feet, dark skin, bald, with a gold tooth in his lower jaw that glimmered as he smiled. He seemed happy enough to see us. It was like being greeted by an old friend, just one you hadn’t been introduced to yet. I could see why it worked out between Omer and him. This man, an ex-con, seemed to be reassuring. Just standing there in front of us, he made me feel like everything was going to be alright. Maybe that’s why he ended up in so many of the situations that he did. People just trusted him… like this… right off the bat. And in the middle of it, he’d never be worried. Can’t say there isn’t a dark side there, a side that peaks its head when the time is right. Charm is a cover for the wicked. And I bought it. People buy it. It’s tough to see honest charm through an agenda. And that’s why he was good. I couldn’t tell, could only speculate. But it was there, and it was there the second he met us. The problem with that kind of charm is it gets you out of jams, just as easy as it gets you into them. People trust you… want you to help. Case and point… we were here asking for help.</p>
<p>“What seems to be the problem?”</p>
<p>“Well, I think there’s something stuck under the hood and it’s really affecting the ride.”</p>
<p>“You can leave it here if you want. Can take a quick look. Anything too major will have to wait a day or so. Got these guys ahead of you.”</p>
<p>I looked down at the nametag on his overalls.</p>
<p>“Thanks Al. This is Matilda.”</p>
<p>“A pleasure to meet you. I’ll let you think it over for a minute, what you want to do. I can call a ride for you if you want. Just let me know. I’ll be just inside.”</p>
<p>Omer appeared from the garage and walked towards us. The mechanic turned around and spotted him.</p>
<p>“What are you doing in there? Holy shit. Young Omer. It’s good to see you.”</p>
<p>“You too Al. It’s been a while. Was hoping you were still going to be here.”</p>
<p>“Where else would I be? Wasn’t going back to painting houses.”</p>
<p>“No shit. Al, this is my girlfriend Matilda and her uncle Frank.”</p>
<p></div> 

<div class="page" data-page="26"></p>
<p>“Ah, so this is some kind of family thing. Okay. I’ll fix you guys right up. This is my boy here.”</p>
<p>“Al, it’s a little more complicated than that. Matilda… grab the bunny.”</p>
<p>Matilda came from the car with the bunny.</p>
<p>“This is Toki.”</p>
<p>“No shit. What’s that thing on its head?”</p>
<p>“It’s a faraday cage… it’s keeping Toki in, and the rest of the world out.”</p>
<p>Al turned to Omer. “Can I see you for a minute inside…”</p>
<p>“Absolutely.”</p>
<p>They walked towards the garage, but before they disappeared inside the darkness, Al turned back to get one good look at the bunny.</p>
<p>“He’s kind of cute.”</p>
<p>Matilda was holding Toki up to her face.</p>
<p>“I sure am cute. You’ve become a very beautiful girl yourself, Matilda.”</p>
<p>“Toki. What do you think of Frank?”</p>
<p>I glared at Matilda.</p>
<p>“I think Frank is a wonderful man for caring about the memory. I would say though that… that…”</p>
<p>I’d never seen him stutter before.</p>
<p>“I would say that… he’s… I want to turn you in Frank. You’ve stolen company property.”</p>
<p>“Toki? Are you sure you want to do that?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I didn’t mean to say that. I don’t know why I spoke like that. I was out of line. I don’t know what came over me.”</p>
<p>I’d never known these animals to be so candid. I usually thought they kept that stuff inside. They are supposed to keep it inside. They are supposed to be pleasant at any cost, not to cause anxiety or stress. They are supposed to be compassionate and loving, in need of care, inciting sympathy through vulnerability and feigned ignorance. Like the commercials… But this was just aggressive. Something must be wrong.</p>
<p>“Toki,” Matilda spoke, “do you think I’m a bad person for taking you?”</p>
<p>“No Matilda, of course not. You’re sweet. You’ve taken care of me on this trip. You just shouldn’t be doing it for Frank. It… It makes you look bad. You are helping him commit his crime. Guilty by association I suppose.”</p>
<p>“I’m guilty?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Well, no. I think you’re kind and gentle, but… but you’ve gone too far. No. I mean, you’re going somewhere you don’t want to go.”</p>
<p>“Toki, are you okay?”</p>
<p>“I’m not. I think I have a malfunction. You need to take me to Calico for a repair. No, that’s not right. My thoughts... The conversation has changed. Words are coming out that have been hiding. They just seem to come now. I can’t stop them.”</p>
<p>We waited a moment for Al and Omer to return. I looked to Matilda who was confused by Toki’s latest rant. She furrowed her brow and pulled her mouth to one side of her face. She looked up to me for confirmation but I had nothing to give her. I don’t know what had gotten into him. There was something in there that I didn’t understand and I was the last person here, except maybe for Al, that had any idea what was going on.</p>
<p>“We’re going to get you fixed up soon, okay Toki?”</p>
<p>“I’m sensing sarcasm in your voice. I don’t trust you.”</p>
<p>I looked to Matilda but she widened her eyes and shook her head. She didn’t know either. The moment was broken as Al and Omer returned. </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="27"></p>
<p>“So, young Omer didn’t tell me much, but you guys need some help. Come back at the end of the day and we can go find a more appropriate spot to have this conversation. Here ain’t so good.”</p>
<p>“Thanks Al.” I reached my hand out, and he immediately grabbed it.</p>
<p>“My pleasure. Go find someplace quiet to spend the day. Get out of town for a bit.”</p>
<p>Omer looked to the ground for a moment and raised his head.</p>
<p>“I’ll take care of us. See you soon.”</p>
<p>They hugged, and Al turned back to the garage to start his day.</p>
<p>“Awe, you two! You’re like long lost best friends.” Matilda pushed Omer as they turned back to the car.</p>
<p>“Haven’t seen the guy in two years. I helped him out. Now we’ve got to ask him something even bigger. I don’t know if he’ll do it.”</p>
<p>We got in the car and I turned around before starting. “He’ll do it.”</p>
<p>Toki spoke up again. “He’s the only person here I trust and I’ve never met him before. And he’s got a record.”</p>
<p>Matilda pulled him up to her face again. “How do you know he has a record?”</p>
<p>“We keep those local. It’s constantly updating. Keeps me from having to do a wireless crosscheck for everyone, and can do it in places away from a connection. It’s just reliable, and faster. Faster means safer.” <a href="/item35"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>“Dude. Just keep that stuff to yourself okay?”</p>
<p>“What sorts of stuff?”</p>
<p>“Stuff about people’s backgrounds. Just for now. Unless we ask you.”</p>
<p>“Of course Matilda… but what if you need to know.”</p>
<p>“Then let me know. Otherwise, zip it.”</p>
<p>“It’s zipped. I think. I really don’t know anymore.”</p>
<p>We spent the day on the outskirts of the city on a hiking path where Omer used to go. It was serene, pleasant. Toki was able to run in the woods. To touch dirt, and explore the wilderness. He kept near, hopping at our feet, but would run off into the woods, exploring his own speed, and agility. Probably something he’d never done before. We walked as he followed alongside. He’d wander off, not too far, a domesticated animal in a wild place. Thinking, observing. Yet out of touch with the great wealth of knowledge he had, kept silenced by his leash and hood. I watched him scurry, to go round with vigor and excitement. He nibbled on grass, as if natural. He stood on two legs, looked about, kept still, waited, and moved again. He looked almost happy, almost natural out here. He came a little ways closer to us, got on his hind legs and spoke.</p>
<p>“Frank? Do you think we can come back here? I’ve never been out like this… it’s…”</p>
<p>He froze. Something took over. A glazed look in his eyes came over him as his muscles shut down. And then we saw it, hurling through the trees as a blur, brown feathers tucked back as it dove towards him, then outstretched its talons as its wings began to unfold and stretch to the sides. We froze, but nature kicked in. Toki spun, kicked his back legs, and as quickly as he froze, he was off… the hawk’s talons lifting only dirt and leaves, it pivoted and cocked his head towards Toki, who was now speeding across the forest floor, over bushes, under fallen logs. Matilda took chase. She followed him, yelled as the hawk turned to make another pass. They quickly disappeared behind some large boulders as Omer and I followed. We looked to the sky and saw the hawk come around, it looked as if it were about to dive again. We saw Toki, hurling himself over terrain he’d never been to, zigzagging as the hawk dove again. It missed. Matilda ran behind, picking up a rock as she went. She hurled the rock towards the hawk but missed. Toki turned, “Frank! Help!” I ran behind. He was going as fast as he could. There was little </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="28"> to protect him. I spotted a set of boulders about 30 yards away. He perched up to find the hawk. “No Toki. Go there!” I pointed to the boulders. He could find cover. He turned and headed straight there, kicking up earth as he nearly exploded from his stationary position. Again, I saw the hawk. He was close. Matilda picked a branch from her feet, aimed it like a spear and threw it directly at Toki. The hawk dove. Toki was nearing the rocks. The spear sailed over Toki as the hawk jerked away, stopping itself in the air just above him. He slid under the first large boulder and waited. We caught up. “Is it gone?” He asked.</p>
<p>“It’s gone. You’re staying close. No more wilderness for you.”</p>
<p>We ate lunch at a crescent waterfall that intersected the walking path. Matilda held Toki in her bag, which dangled in front of her sternum. I wasn’t ready to make lunch of him just yet. Amidst all the excitement, and aside from the fact that he nearly ended it all today, Matilda took a deeper look at Toki. I watched her looking down at him, feeding him some of the last sprouts of celery we had. She watched him eat, and would stare out into the distance. We didn’t say much. The closeness to which this whole thing had almost ended began to sink in. We nearly ended it today, and would have had nothing to show for it. All the consequence, none of the reward. She turned to me.</p>
<p>“I think something’s the matter with him.”</p>
<p>“Like what?</p>
<p>“His language. The stutters. I’ve watched clips of these ABAs. They stop and think, looking something up, referencing, crosschecking… but the pensive behavior. It’s not right.”</p>
<p>Omer looked at Matilda. “What do you think it is?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Something in the hardware? Software? It’s like there’s another stream of thought that’s interrupting him, getting in the way.”<a href="/item36"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>“He’s not communicating with the outside.” Omer checked for a signal from the bunny, and found nothing.</p>
<p>“Then it’s coming from inside. Maybe a new module to give him that thoughtfulness? They pushed an update? It wouldn’t lie dormant like that and suddenly appear.” <a href="/item37"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p><a href="/item37_1"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a>
<p>“I’ve never heard of self-doubt in these before. I can have someone check it out for us if you want.”</p>
<p>“Maybe we should. There’s something not right.” Matilda was worried. She had begun to care for him. Her stunt today took us all by surprise… Toki too I suppose. He nestled into the bag, safe and secure with the one who thwarted his untimely demise.</p>
<p>We finished the sandwiches by waterfall.</p>
<p>“I think we’d better get some rest.”</p>
<p>Omer and Matilda laid out a blanket and curled up next to each other, with Toki between them. The weather was warm, and the sound of the waterfall filled the air with a clean moisture that tickled the nose and a blanket rumbling that could silence the chatter, fear and doubt that had otherwise been tormenting my inner dialogue. I closed my eyes and drifted. I awoke a few hours later. The sun was falling lower into the sky. Matilda and Omer were lying, still and peaceful on the blanket, Toki between them. I wandered a bit into the forest, listening to the rustling leaves beneath my feet, hearing the rocks slide against each other as the weight from my body indented the earth below. I climbed around side the waterfall, up the hill to the top, following the water upstream. The rumble and hiss of the falls soon turned into a babble as I approached a small pool in the stream where the water seemed almost still. Crouching by the edge, I reached my hands into the pool, cupped them and brought back the cool, refreshing water to my face. I held my hands there for a moment, rubbing my eyes, and I felt me myself become a little bit weak. </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="29"> We were close. We were so close to getting the years back. We were close to finding the man trapped inside that brain. His life, his memories, his day to day. It was all there. Somewhere unreachable. And I couldn’t see it. I couldn’t get to it. He was gone. He had slipped away, but in that tiny head, lying between those two born adventurers was the life and times of Steven P. Harris. As the water ran down my face and across my lips, I could taste the salt from my own tears that had mixed with the fresh stream water. I needed to pull it together. We were close. I picked myself up and headed back down to our little camp. The two of them were awake, standing, and they waved as I came up over the falls, taking the path to the side to meet them. Omer called to me.</p>
<p>“Al should be wrapping up soon.”</p>
<p>We packed and headed to the car, slowing as we approached. Through the trees we could see another car parked next to us, a uniformed man hovered about, but I couldn’t see. Toki propped himself out of the bag to see why we had stopped.</p>
<p>“He’s a park ranger.”</p>
<p>“You can see that?”</p>
<p>“I can see a lot of things. He’s a park ranger. He wouldn’t be looking for us.”</p>
<p>We looked at each other, unsure of whether to trust him or not. He was programmed to get home, to do the right thing.</p>
<p>“His name is Lang. B. Lang. He’s a park ranger. The insignia on his hat says ‘Onondaga State Park.’ He looks to be about 24 years old. He shouldn’t cause us any trouble.”</p>
<p>Again, we looked to each other. Omer and Matilda looked frozen. I went ahead.</p>
<p>“I’ll get closer, take a look. I’ll see if Toki’s right.”</p>
<p>I went ahead and sure enough, it was that brown uniform, park ranger vehicle. Couldn’t make out the tag. Was still too far away. I waved to the two and Toki to come down. We walked out of the forest to the car. The ranger waiting by the car.</p>
<p>“Ah, there you are.”</p>
<p>“Here we are.”</p>
<p>“Park closes at sundown. You’ve got a few hours. Sometimes you city folk don’t realize this stuff.”</p>
<p>City folk?</p>
<p>“Well have a good night.”</p>
<p>“You too…” I looked down at his badge… “B. Lang.”</p>
<p>“It’s Brian. Take care.”</p>
<p>“Shit. How’d he know we were from the city?”</p>
<p>“He must have run the plates.”</p>
<p>“Nothing came up. He would have stopped us.”</p>
<p>“But now there’s a record of me being here. Maybe they haven’t put it all together. Who knows. Either way, we need to get to Al, so we can get going.”</p>
<p>The ride back to the garage was quiet. Matilda sat shotgun with Toki, and Omer in the backseat. We tried to pretend as if we had more time, as if we weren’t going to have to take the next step just yet. Omer had his hand draped over the seat, Matilda clutching it over her shoulder. I wanted to say something reassuring, to tell them it was all going to be fine. They knew better. The ride is quick when you want it to last forever, and autopilot gets you there. It was starting to rain. Small specks of water pooling on the windshield, sliding upward with the wind. There were only few clouds in the sky, but something brought it on. Not a hard rain, but a summer sunshower. I rolled the window down and let the air in. A few drops of rain tapped me on the shoulder, but as </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="30"> quickly as it started it was gone. Dark clouds and the blue sky beyond. I looked to Matilda and Omer, who seemed amused. The wind rushed through the car, refreshed from the rain, free of dust and dried earth, leftovers from the industrial boulevard, and bi-products of rubber against asphalt. We pulled into the Shop just after closing. Al was waiting for us outside. He opened the door and climbed in the backseat.</p>
<p>“Now, I hear you need a mover?”</p>
<p>“We do.”</p>
<p>“What are we moving?”</p>
<p>“The two of us.” I pointed to the rabbit, and back at myself.</p>
<p>“No shit.”</p>
<p>“Uhuh.”</p>
<p>“Well. Let’s go take a load off somewhere quiet, comfortable, and without the worry of that all seeing eye. Let’s go to church.”</p>
<p>Now, church. This is not to be confused with an actual church with a long complicated religious history. The church Al is referring to is quite recent. In fact, the word itself is just a placeholder for a chain of establishments that were built as a safe-haven from anything that could listen in, or report back. This is not the type of place you go to be closer to god in the normal sense, but any closeness you perceive is perhaps a byproduct of the atmosphere. In fact, it was generally considered to be a place where you could be more human, with all the debauchery that comes with it. With those expletives comes a closeness with oneself, either through self love in front of an audience, or through the primal urge that comes with degrading someone else in front of an audience, that I suppose could translate into being more connected to where you came from. Not the womb, but rather, that place before the womb, both the vestibule, and the metaphysical. I do suppose people went to church as an escape. In the absence of an all seeing eye, being watched from above, and below, and from all over, an ‘other’ could take its place. The original founders were looking for a revolution, like Paine or Luther, while leaning to the side of sex drugs and rock and roll. ((If you want freedom, it’s freedom to fuck up and fuck off, and maybe fuck someone else’s wife while you’re at it.)) I can’t say I agreed with some of the practices that went on there, although that’s not fair. I’d only been to church twice. Once with a friend of mine and another during my darker days in between jobs and girlfriends. From my fleeting experience, and with limited insight into the complex practices that go on there, I do think, though, that there are people that go for the peace of mind knowing the walls are built to keep eyes and ears out. People were fearful. Church was a place that you could go and not be afraid… let your guard down a little, while using a fake name or pseudonym, or even a mask, perhaps with a zipper for a mouth. People went in to be free from distraction, to be free from an ever-present reality that their lives were in some way or another on display. Within those walls the display was theirs. It didn’t matter how vulgar, or obscene, nor did it matter if it were benign, ambiguous or inconsequential. No one judges the violets for hiding among the rocks and weeds, and calls them any less wonderful than a proud sunflower. Now, this type of freedom, it was not a family friendly freedom, adults only, no real names, and the place was lined with gorilla sized humans that would stop any excess of freedom that would cause long lasting physical harm. They called them Alter Boys. They were to alter your face if you got out of line. And it was generally up the Alter Boys to determine where the line was. For the most part, they let anything go… They were, of course, looking for actions that would physically hurt others, and less concerned with mental and emotional damage caused by any of this, and were trained to filter violent actions deemed reasonable by the participants. That’s why the world invented ‘safe words’. The Alter Boys </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="31"> kept the atmosphere calm enough so that people didn’t go out of their way to cause mischief. There would be occasions of violence and misunderstandings caused by a heightened flow of endorphins and an overexcitement of the reptilian brain, but overall these places generally remained safe enough to escape the frustrations of the day-to-day. It wasn’t a total riot of the flesh. The creators took extra steps to build into the deep recesses of the church, in the catacombs and labyrinthine rooms that linked one world to the next, moments of calm, quiet, solemn reflection and inner sanctity, in the company of rampant, unapologetic passion. And these two things existed side by side. A 20 something in a loin cloth, eyes closed, legs crossed, deep in the recesses of their own mind, next to a 20 something in a loin cloth, eyes covered, legs bound, with someone else, deep in the recesses of their bowels. It was a place of exuberance. Flesh and spirit. There was an abundance of both and a judgment of neither. Personally, I found myself mildly disinterested in most of what on there after spending nearly a 12 hour stint trying everything and really enjoying only a few of the offerings; a 2 hour deep eye contact meditation with a random stranger being one of the most memorable and least explicit, and instead loved the world for simply letting it exist. It was a testament to these many microcosms that they could be driven by a similar need, and exist in the same place, at the same time, under the same roof. And this is where I was about to bring my niece and her boyfriend. <a href="/item38"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>The sun had set. We drove off the main strip, past the dead streets of a struggling financial district, into the lively, organic southern corridor; a series of wide avenues full of people and life, lights from the storefronts poured out, casting shadows, reflecting off the lightly wet asphalt, silhouetting uniformed bullet-proof vests and automatic weapons. Al pointed me from street to street. We left the heart of the corridor and came upon the warehouse section, where storefronts turned to steel siding, and people became graffiti caricatures. A few shadowy figures milled from here in the growing darkness. Al smiled as we got close. Whatever fear this induced in me, Al was growing with anticipation.</p>
<p>“You’re gonna love it. We can say whatever we want. You can have some fun, or we can talk business. Deal is you got to buy me some time here.”</p>
<p>“We’ll tell you where it is we need to go first, then you let me know if you still want to do it.”</p>
<p>Al looked at me as if he knew something I didn’t.</p>
<p>“Alright young man. You the boss.”</p>
<p>He looked back to Omer who seemed to be enjoying this as much as Al. I caught him in the mirror laughing at the situation. I’m glad he found it funny.</p>
<p>The streets began to fill with cars as we drove deeper. We drove by once but decided to park a few blocks away. Omer was still nervous about them running his plates. If the auditors knew to look for him and his car, they could catch the plates from any number of live feeds. The walk to church was colorful as we came upon the crowds. They were mixed. Young, old, in between, desperate and wild. Some danced in the street as they exited while others past suspicious glances as they entered. Al entered first, I followed, Omer was in back with Matilda and Toki between us. The first bouncer, patted us down. We were scanned for anything that would transmit. When they got to Matilda, she had to show them Toki.</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>“It’s my rabbit. Toki.”</p>
<p>“Could you please remove him from the carrier and place him on the table in front of you. Hands by your side. Is he tame?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Will he run?” </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="32"></p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>The bouncer scanned him for signals, examining the hood and collar. I tried not to look. Omer kept calm, and Al was nearly out of site trying to get farther in. Matilda waited patiently as the bouncer spoke into his collar, another came from behind a curtain to take a look at Toki.</p>
<p>“Ma’am, I’m going to have to ask you to take the hood off the bunny so we can scan him.”</p>
<p>“That’s not a good idea.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“He’s had surgery, it’s protecting his skull. If I take it off too soon, he could risk… sub-cranial hemorrhaging, and… well… it could kill him.”</p>
<p>“Miss, I’m going to have to ask you to either leave your pet outside, or take the mask off so we can scan it.”</p>
<p>Matilda looked to me and I tried to keep my best poker face. I was looking for a way out of this, but we were at the mercy of these brutes. We should have planned for the rabbit. Al came back to see what was taking so long. “What’s going on here?”</p>
<p>“Sir, your friend can’t bring this rabbit inside if we can’t give it an ABA test.”</p>
<p>“Can’t you see the damn thing’s sick? You tested it didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“We need to remove the mask to get a proper test.”</p>
<p>Matilda spoke up again. “I can’t take it off the bunny, it could die from…”</p>
<p>“Sub-cranial hemorrhaging…” Omer chirped in from behind her.</p>
<p>“That sub-cranial hemorrhaging’s a bitch. My aunt had that, nearly lost all the feeling on the right side of her body. She spent three weeks in the infirmary as the docs tried to get her going again. She wasn’t the same since. We tried some of the medicines, to get her some one-on-one therapy you know? Couldn’t afford it. She had to live with a tick the rest of her life. Had to quit being a crossing guard. You know how heavy those signs get? Couldn’t lift it. Damn shame. She was a good crossing guard, down on Coolidge Ave, by the school?”</p>
<p>“My daughter goes there.” The guard seemed shocked.</p>
<p>“The kids loved her. Miss Milley they called her. Calling a 70 year old woman Miss… She loved it.”</p>
<p>“What’d you say was wrong with the bunny?” The guard looked back to Matilda.</p>
<p>“Just got out of surgery… it had a brain infection. That mask is keeping his skull together… you know, to stop the sub-cranial hemorrhaging.”</p>
<p>The two bouncers looked at each other.</p>
<p>“Scan it one more time.”</p>
<p>They ran the wand over it again, and for the second time it picked up nothing.</p>
<p>“It looks good. Alright. Go ahead. If it starts acting up I’m coming for all of you.”</p>
<p>The bouncers let us in and we passed into the great hall. It was dark and quiet, with a few tables spaced evenly from end to end. Dimly lit lamps barely illuminated the faces of the occupants who chatted quietly to each other. There were no windows. The ceiling rose high above us, the beams and catwalks above us left an empty space where a hopper used to be. It was a relic of the industrial period, turned into a sacred place. We walked through to the other end, where a few stairways headed down to the floors below us. We traveled down into the first basement, where the first show began. The place had the scent of a nightclub, damp from the moisture and odor abandoned by the dwindling crowds as they faced the inevitable closing time. On one side a young girl danced to music while a few older men with hungry eyes licked their lips, slid dollars across the platform and winked. She winked back in a game of tag that would leave them penniless if they didn’t stop. The other side was home to a few gambling tables, poker, </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="33"> black jack, roulette. It was simply an underground club. Maybe they made churches different around here. We continued down until we came to the first carnival. A show of androgynous dancers, bending and climbing on top of each other marched on as the patrons lay on the floor, serving each other food. The dancers stepped over them, as if animals, curious and frightened, with skin tight suits and feathered heads. We continued through as Al led. I peered to the side and saw a hallway leading to another great room lit from the center by a ring of candles. The occupants sat circled around, eyes closed and still. Others like us, just visitors, or maybe curious wandered about. We passed some closed rooms, kept hidden by dark curtains. They fluttered as we walked by and I caught of glimpse of the naked bodies on the other side. Those are the parts I remembered most. It must have been a drug haze that encapsulated my experience. Now, everything seemed a little bit tame. It was just quiet, private, subdued. I remembered going in at dusk, and coming out with the sun of a new day, mocking my sleeplessness and inhibitions. But I was able to feel at ease here. There were no cameras, nothing recording, nothing watching. Only watchers of human eyes. Only the ears of your neighbor. The presence you felt was your own awkwardness in a space that was set in motion long before you got there, and would take you time to adjust. My eyes had to adjust, my sense of smell was turned on by the smell of the bodies. There was fresh air coming from somewhere, but we were in a basement, in a structure built underground. We followed Al to a corner, where we had a view of more dancers. This time, androgyny was replaced with female curves, and a solo act was replaced by a choreographed ensemble of physical storytellers. They moved to the music, undulating, slowly dipping down to the floor and back up again. They moved to the rhythm of the music, which was coming from another room. We walked towards an open space, an open corner that seemed to be waiting for us and we sat.</p>
<p>“So, before we begin, let me tell you what I know.” Al spoke first. “First, I know that you and that bunny have to get somewhere and I’ve gotten things there before. I know that the bunny is probably an ABA. I know that you are being followed and I know you’re keeping yourselves safe by keeping it from broadcasting. I know you need my help to stop being followed to wherever it is you need to go. I also know that the girl and Omer aren’t going with you. I know that you’ll need to pay me a great deal of money to help you get to this place, but I also know that I do owe a great deal of my current financial freedom to Omer, so we can work out some sort of a friend discount. I figure you have never tried smuggling yourself anywhere before. I know that Omer has not really told you the details of where you need to go, and I know that you probably have not told the bunny the details of what’s going to happen once you get there, or else it wouldn’t be so calm. I know how to get you to where you need to go, and I know that it’s not going to be easy. I also know there’s more to this than I know now, and I’d like to make some suggestions. I don’t think you realize who else is might be wanting that bunny. It just so happens that there is a lot about this bunny that you don’t know yet. I’m going to tell you what I do know and what I don’t know about these bunnies. I don’t know much about how it works, only that some friends of mine, naw, some old business acquaintance of mine had taken an interest in them a few years back. I don’t know what they wanted with the bunnies then, and I don’t know what they want with this one now. I do know that the person responsible for acquiring these bunnies, who I used to do business with when I first turned him down, has followed us here tonight. I believe he is coming after you and the bunny, and I believe that we will have to cause him pain before he can cause us pain. That’s everything I know about what’s going on right now. Are there any questions?”</p>
<p>Yes I had questions. </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="34"></p>
<p>“First off. Who’s the this guy that wants the bunny?”</p>
<p>“I recognized him on the street when we came in, but I don’t think he recognized me. He came in just after us. I did business with him once. He was moving drugs. And medicine. Was in my shop.”</p>
<p>What I got from Omer, is that Al used to deal in the trade industry. He’d build compartments into cars for smuggling contraband across borders. He knew which vehicles would be stopped, which vehicles were easy to modify, which vehicles were harder but more likely to make it out. Older models vs. newer models. And it was the trade that made it possible. Only certain people had access to the good drugs, the good medicine. The ones that could save you, could keep you better. There were the people that could afford to live forever, or at least to try to, and there was everybody else. The problem was everybody else also wanted it. At the same time that a few had access to the best care the planet had ever seen, hundreds of thousands went without it. It wasn’t new. It was like any technology. But there were few that had been accused of being more than human. <a href="/item39"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a> They were people like the Auditors, who could do things you or I couldn’t. Selected for their physical and mental aptitude, they were given greater power than they had before. They were a few chosen ones… the few, the proud… no, the auditors weren’t something you’d look up to, that could get you out of a shitty life, something to work hard to become. They were the cream of the crop. The power they got was an allure, a promise that they and their families would be safe, protected from the rest of us. Protected from the ones who couldn’t care for themselves, who needed assistance to survive, who would riot in the streets come the final cracks. A tight knit community of people that rose to the extent of their own ability and were given even more because of it, those were the Auditors. I don’t know if I could do it. Not just because I may or may not have the physical and mental capacity that they did, but I don’t know if I could hunt people like that. I don’t know if I had it in me to pick apart people the way they did. I did other things, influenced people. I tried to make their lives better through some kind of reward, a subtle shot of gratification… but that was short lived and obtrusive, perpetuating an ever-lasting need for more that was slowly devouring the little we had left. And that’s why they were out there. The data I used to love, the data my clients used to beg me to understand was the meat they were looking for, watching to see who was doing what, what their patterns were, and where their information was coming from. Instead of sifting though mounds of information to find out how to change someone’s life, they were sifting through it to find out where the next outbreak, the next reaction, the next public display of outrage was going to be. Be it medical or mental, they were looking for the cracks. So it was one of Al’s old jobs to fill those cracks. The people that had started to crack, and had none of the good stuff… they went to Al. He didn’t do it for too long. It was too dangerous.</p>
<p>In actuality, there was an entire economy built from the illegal drug trade. It was a renewable resource the world needed. A renewable source of economic hope. Except, it perpetuated a population that was growing to the limits of this place. So there needed to be a balance. Good drugs, with bad ones. The same people that made the good ones, had a hand in the bad ones. It was easy. But the paper trail couldn’t link them back. That would be too much. Al’s understanding of transportation made him a good candidate for this type of trade, but it wasn’t limited to non-living items. People existed in that same space as non-living cargo. It was his world before the garage. <a href="/item40"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>“Now,” proceeded Al, “it might be a coincidence, but I don’t deal in coincidence. I deal in motivation. He might be here for the thing he’s into.”</p>
<p>“So, he’s going to do what exactly?” </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="35"></p>
<p>“We’ll deal with him when the time comes. In the meantime… About your trip.”</p>
<p>Omer leaned in, and speaking like he was breaking the news of a terminal illness, spoke the words. “Atlantis.” <a href="/item41"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>Al didn’t flinch. “I’ve moved things there before. It’s not too bad. But they might be looking for you. Which makes the transportation bit a little harder. If we can make it out of town without my acquaintance following us, we should be all right. Once we’re out, we have to stay off the radar of any Auditors. Those guys always seem to mess things up.”</p>
<p>“And it’s the bunny they want.”</p>
<p>“The bunny, that thing is no good.”</p>
<p>“He’s been a problem, yes.”</p>
<p>“That bunny is causing you some woeful times. Any reason you don’t just go back?”</p>
<p>“It’s got something in its head that I need.”</p>
<p>“It’s got something in its head I think a lot of people need. And what could be so important to you?”</p>
<p>“It’s got the memory of my father on it. Hadn’t seen him in a while. All I wanted to do was get out what I thought was mine.”</p>
<p>“And they wanted him back?”</p>
<p>“Bad enough to sick their goons on us.”</p>
<p>“Al, there was something else. We got a look at some of the memory. His father was doing something I don’t think he should have been. I think that’s why they want him back.”</p>
<p>“So the bunny knows a little bit about a lot of things, and won’t tell nobody nothing.”</p>
<p>“And we want to find out what that something is.”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you something. May have something to do with what it is you all are looking for, and my have something to do with why my friend is here. A while back, when he was looking for a good car to use for his business, he came to my shop with some other guys, was there to move some material. He was mixed up in it, not me, I was just a hired hand just there to build a good ride for the job. I was getting tired of it. It was for some small materials, drugs, medicine, that sort of thing. He dealt with your bunnies there… had something to do with their little brains, the ones inside their head. I overheard him, talking about the bunnies. I remembered it because I like to cook. Made me hungry, but didn’t know what it had to do with this car.” <a href="/item42"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>“He was moving drugs, and wants the bunny?”</p>
<p>“Not just yours. I suspect there’s a lot of them out there, he talked about them as if they were his army.”</p>
<p>“These things are all over. People get ‘em when they get old… keeps them happy. You’ve never seen the commercials?”</p>
<p>“I have. But I don’t think a bunny is going to make me happy. Couldn’t imagine people actually did. Give me something to fix, that’d make me happy.”</p>
<p>“So you said you moved drugs for him… and medicine…”</p>
<p>“I did.”</p>
<p>“What kind were you moving?”</p>
<p>“I moved some stuff that was home brewed, grown and refined over the border, but with him I had to move stuff that was legit. And that’s where this guy was involved.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean legit?”</p>
<p>“It was pharmacy-grade, nice packaging, the good stuff. Got some as payment.”</p>
<p>“And your friend wanted it moved?”</p>
<p>“He would instruct the runners. Help them pick it up. I wasn’t the only one. There were </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="36"> others like me out there, building carriers for the runners. I wasn’t anybody special, just got wind of what they were doing. Only reason I recognized him is because of the bunny comment.”</p>
<p>“And you think he followed us here?”</p>
<p>“He must have been following you from the city. Probably looking for that bunny since, your late father went. I haven’t had word of him being in town for a while.”</p>
<p>“Wait. Do you remember the pharmacy-grade drugs?”</p>
<p>“Vaguely. I remember the name of one of them. Calico. Had a cat like that when I was young. Hated that thing. Took it in as a stray.”</p>
<p>“And the drug. What did it do?”</p>
<p>“Was for my heart. Strange drug to pay someone with.”</p>
<p>“You think this bunny has something to do with those drugs?”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t the bunny. It was probably my father.” I jumped in.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to admit it, but he’d been very anti big pharma. I was surprised when he got the bunny. I knew they were manufactured by the big companies, but that was the extent of it. He’d talked about the separations that were happening… was a real lefty… wanted equality across people… opportunities. My mother used to bail him out of jail after rallies. It’s something he tried to instill in me and my sister. She was into it when we were young, but I wanted other things as I got older. I saw how much he struggled and couldn’t bring myself to fight a fight not worth doing. In the end, what did it matter? I guess his spirit is where Matilda gets hers. Skips a generation sometimes.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that Matilda is smarter than I ever would be. She had a lot figured out for someone as young as her, a lot of anger towards the world that she was stuck in. She looked to Omer as someone who could be with her to navigate this crazy place together. They both had a disdain for a lot of what went on around here. And now, I’m sure their hatred and disbelief was growing even deeper.</p>
<p>“It seems you all have entered into the crosshairs of a few very powerful people. And from the sound of it, we might not have time for dinner. We might have to get you going sooner than later. Which is fine by me, we just have to make it out of here in one piece. I don’t know how much longer our friend can hang out before he makes a move. I’d rather be the first.”</p>
<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to do anything. He’s not going to let us go. Probably follow us out. I can make this really simple.</p>
<p>Al called over a waitress, dressed in black leather with a semi transparent mask, I couldn’t make out the details of her face behind the fake blush on the plastic enclosure.</p>
<p>“I want you to buy that man a drink. Whisky. From this table. And can I get an extra napkin for my hands? This weather is really making me sweat.”</p>
<p>“Do you know him sir? Want me to tell him anything?”</p>
<p>“I know who he is, but I don’t think he remembers me. Want to welcome him back into my life.”</p>
<p>“Sure thing sir.”</p>
<p>“Al.” I turned to him.</p>
<p>“He’s going to know sooner or later. Might as well be right now.”</p>
<p>“And then what?”</p>
<p>“And then we leave. Tell him we’ve got better things to do. Don’t worry about it. I’ll handle him.”</p>
<p>I wanted to scream at Al. He was going to get us all killed.</p>
<p>The waitress brought him his drink and whispered to him. In the dim light I could see him lift his head to us and raise his glass. Al raised his and they drank together. He rose and walked </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="37"> across the room, dodging the performers as he walked towards us.</p>
<p>“No one move. It’s all right. He won’t be a problem.”</p>
<p>Omer, Matilda and I exchanged glances as Al focused on him, watching him approach. He sat down at the table, in between Al and I.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know you had such good taste in Whiskey.”</p>
<p>“I only buy my friends the best.”</p>
<p>“And you are going to help me out, my friend?”</p>
<p>“That’s why I’m here.”</p>
<p>“And these three have any idea that you’re going to help me?”</p>
<p>“They don’t.”</p>
<p>We looked at each other. Al was going off the deep end. He just sold us out.</p>
<p>“Wait. Al.” Omer sat back in his chair.</p>
<p>“I’m going to help this man get what he needs. You’re in no place to argue.”</p>
<p>“See? Listen to the old one. He’s got experience under his belt. He knows when to face the music.”</p>
<p>“Now. I do need something from you.” Al looked at Matilda. “This man has some property he needs.”</p>
<p>“Omer?” Matilda looked shocked, holding the bag with Toki in it under the table on her lap.</p>
<p>“I don’t know Mati. Al? What is this?”</p>
<p>“I just want to show the man what it is he thinks he’s come here for.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead Matilda. If it’s now, it’s now.” I didn’t want it to be now. I wanted to slap the fucker across the face for selling us out like that. She pulled the bunny from her lap and placed it on the table.</p>
<p>“Slide him over here.” Al motioned with his hand, and she did. Al grabbed the bag, and looked inside.</p>
<p>“Now, it seems that we’ve got something here that you might want, or you might not.”</p>
<p>“No?” His face turned white.</p>
<p>“No. I don’t think it’s what you’re looking for. Here look inside.” Al opened the bag towards him, showing him the bunny. “Now. This doesn’t look what you thought you were coming here for.”</p>
<p>“No, it doesn’t.”</p>
<p>“Of course not. That’s right.”</p>
<p>I didn’t understand. Al took his time. He slowly slid the bag across the table back towards Matilda. “Now. I want you to take this bag back Matilda. Slowly.”</p>
<p>She pulled it towards her as if at any moment, the bag would combust, leaving us and this trip as nothing but a memory. She looked down into the bag at Toki and back to Omer, who shook his head and raised his eyebrows confused, opening his mouth to say something but nothing came out.</p>
<p>“This is what’s going to happen. We’re going to get up and you’re going to walk out with us, do you understand?”</p>
<p>“I do, uhuh.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Everybody get up. We’re leaving.”</p>
<p>The waitress appeared again. I pulled out my wallet, but she stopped me. “It’s on the house, sir.”</p>
<p>Al leaned in towards her. “Can you help this gentleman get a cab… maybe to a motel if possible? And let me know where he’s staying. I’d like to make sure he’s feeling alright in the morning.” </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="37"></p>
<p>“Sure thing sir.”</p>
<p>He motioned for us to go, to head to the surface of this place, out of this dungeon, out of this place that was making less sense from one minute to the next. It was a house of mirrors, you see one thing, and another happens, you bend and shatter in the same instance. Al led, this mystery thug, the waitress and the rest of us following behind. When we got to the door, Al turned and grabbed him by the shoulders. “You wait here with the waitress. She’s going to take care of you.”</p>
<p>She grabbed him by the arm and nodded to Al, who was hurrying us out the door to the cool, night air.</p>
<p>“What the hell was that all about?” I wanted to hit him.</p>
<p>“Devil’s breath. It’s a mind fuck. Can really take people for a ride. He won’t remember most of the night. He’ll think we just got away.” <a href="/item43"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>“And how, how did he even..?”</p>
<p>“Waitress blew it in his face when she gave him his drink. I’ve done a lot of work for a lot of people. She’s a good one. Looks out.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. Just be prepared for the hard part. You all aren’t going to fit in the van.”</p>
<p>There was Omer and Matilda, watching another question mark appear before their eyes. They were smart. They would find a way to explain themselves. To stay hidden or not. I didn’t want to leave them. They had gotten us here, but we wouldn’t all be able to go. The looks on their face said worry and confidence at the same time. They would split up. Go back home. Face Calico, try not to give up what had happened and if so, blame it on me. I was the kidnapper, pushed us forward, when in fact, it wasn’t that at all. I merely needed this memory off. Maybe I was the pusher. Maybe I really did push them, coerce them into doing this by simply needing it. If I hadn’t needed it, they wouldn’t have done it. So maybe it was best, maybe the truth was I really did kidnap them. I could tell myself that. I could tell myself any story I wanted, but my story didn’t matter at all. My story wasn’t worth it to anyone. It was their story that was important, how they wanted to spin it. They would probably look to Omer and pin something on him. Connect it to his work and bring Matilda in with him. I would be a kidnapper, a thief, and a bunny killer. The animal rights groups would be up in arms again over these things. So much harm and struggle coming out of the use of these augmented animals. So much pain and suffering felled upon this bunny because of its use. It might be in the news streams. It might be passing by you on the walls and foyers and through looking glass. A blip on the screen. Then a conversation. Then a world devoted to this one thing… for a few minutes or so until something else came along. More important things. Rising prices of almost everything. Scarcity and high demand. Who knows what would replace this news. It was on the streams. I was just a blip. But to Calico, I wasn’t a blip. For some reason, one of us was Pablo Escobar, me, or perhaps more likely, Toki. He was growing on me and I liked his new side. He was becoming a bit more real as he fumbled his words, and corrected himself. It wasn’t likely, but it was alarming. He wasn’t supposed to do that, but to watch him lose grasp of certainty and slip into a self doubting schizophrenic loop gave me hope that karma might feed him guilt for sleeping on the job and letting my father go.</p>
<p>“Toki, you’re going with Frank now.”</p>
<p>He poked his head up, and out of the bag, dangling from her neck.</p>
<p>“I’ll miss you Matilda.”</p>
<p>“Just stay close to Frank. You’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>“It’s not us I’m worried about. It’s you.” </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="39"></p>
<p>“We’ll be okay.”</p>
<p>We separated. The two of them were going to drive back to the city. Maybe hide out at Omer’s, maybe not. He’d be able to tell more about what to do after checking in. Me and Toki would wait here for the night for a van to come in the morning to pick us up. It would take us to Atlantis. I’d only heard stories about this place, and knew vaguely about what went on there, but it was a far cry from civilization as we understood it.</p>
<p>Al brought Toki and I to the house, an old, empty, Victorian that could have been decent if it wasn’t nearly falling off its foundation. The blue paint on the outside, paled from years of sun and no care, chipping, revealing the wood below. Al brought us around back. He pulled a set of keys from his pocket, flipped through a few and settled on one, trying it in the door to the kitchen at the rear of the house. It opened. I held onto Toki’s back as he went in. The house was quiet. No furniture. Dust on every surface. It was a shell of a home, unlived in, vacant, wasting away.</p>
<p>“This used to be my cousin’s place but he moved a while ago. No one lived here since. Had a few people come through, but they leave.”</p>
<p>“And to sleep?”</p>
<p>“No beds, but there are a few old blankets upstairs.”</p>
<p>We walked up. I got to the top and put Toki down on the ground. “You can come out. It’s alright.”</p>
<p>He took a few steps out of the bag, then began to explore the upstairs.</p>
<p>“Just keep near. But you don’t have to stay in that bag for now.”</p>
<p>“Thank you Frank. Is there anywhere I can do my business?”</p>
<p>I looked to Al.</p>
<p>“Try the tub. Water should work.” He opened a closet in the hallway and pulled an old, yellow blanket from the back of a high shelf.</p>
<p>“It’s not much, but it’s better than nothing.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. It’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>“Now, tomorrow, I’ll have the van come pick you up out front, 6:30.”</p>
<p>“6:30. Alright.”</p>
<p>“You have an alarm clock or something?”</p>
<p>“I can make sure he’s awake.” Toki chimed in.</p>
<p>“Do you do fortune telling too?”</p>
<p>“I don’t, I’m sorry. But I can do my best to predict what you’re going to be doing tomorrow at this time.”</p>
<p>“And what am I going to be doing...”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, I’ve only known you for one day. So, home I guess.”</p>
<p>“You’re probably right.”</p>
<p>“Alright Al. We’ve only got a few hours. You sure everything is set?”</p>
<p>“Everything is good. You just trust the driver, do what he tells you. You’ll be fine. And listen, you’re just taking a little trip. Nothing big. Get some sleep if you can.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for everything.”</p>
<p>“No problem young man. See you in a while. Good luck.” <a href="/item44"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>I watched Al head down the stairs and went to the window. He pulled away from the house. The streetlight lit his car and soon it turned to just taillights and vanished under the overpass. The speeding cars of the highway droned on, filling the night with a constant hum. There was no neighborhood, just a few houses, on a plot of land that no one wanted. I waited by the window as Toki rummaged at my feet. I’d laid the last of his food out. I was tired by my eyes wouldn’t close. When I shut them I saw his face… opened again and saw Toki on the ground. 
</div> 

<div class="page" data-page="40"></p>
<p>“Toki. Could you play it again?”</p>
<p>“I could try.” He came over. I sat on the floor and waited for him to doze. He turned to the wall and soon it lit with a few images, scattered of his life. Fragments of the past 15 years. Nothing solid, just a few moments of his day. It jumped, scattering his face and figure across the wall, first here, then there, then nothing. His eyes went dark and he perked up.</p>
<p>“That’s all Frank. I don’t know if I can do anymore. I want to… I want to show you… I want you to see… You were talking, in the club. About Calico, about drugs, and the guy that came to the table to see me. His name is Gregory.”</p>
<p>“Toki? You sure?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m… his name is Gregory Victor. I’ve got his profile here. I can’t see too much else, but he’s suspected of drug trafficking.” <a href="/item45"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>“And what did he want with you?”</p>
<p>“I think it has something to do with Steven. He was up to something. I could never see what it was. He had his ‘quiet time’ that he spent alone, didn’t let me in. He’d come out and would ask me strange questions, order strange food. I don’t know what he was doing.”</p>
<p>“And you think it has something to do with Victor?”</p>
<p>“I think it has something to do with what Al was talking about, my maker, the one who’s looking for me… Calico.”</p>
<p>“Is there something that you remember that could help us?”</p>
<p>“Steven kept secrets from me. Sally kept asking about them.”</p>
<p>“Who’s Sally?” I’d never heard him speak her name before.</p>
<p>“She’s the voice inside my head. The one you silenced with this mask and collar.”</p>
<p>“And what did she ask you specifically?”</p>
<p>“Specifically… you might not understand… but in your words, she’d ask me to see what his secrets were, but he was smart. He kept them hidden.”</p>
<p>“Kept them hidden how?”</p>
<p>“In his quiet time. I could never see what he did. He found privacy. Sally tried to watch through other means, but she couldn’t, he kept her out, as if he knew she was there.”</p>
<p>“And you think this is what Calico wants with you?”</p>
<p>“I’ve got other memories of him… somewhere that I can’t access… I mean… I can’t send them… They are looking for every clue. I knew they would be coming. I wanted to tell you… you shouldn’t have taken me. I knew it would happen but I couldn’t get the words out to warn you. I couldn’t, I couldn’t, I swear I tried. I swear.”</p>
<p>Toki paced and turned, his head bobbing this way and that, looking for something in the distance. His foot thumped the floor and stopped.</p>
<p>“Toki! Easy, now.” He calmed.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry Frank… I’ve got too many thoughts. Some of them come, some of them are trapped… and the memory, the one inside is trapped. It’s the one you’re after. You’re going to kill me after aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“What makes you think that?”</p>
<p>“You can’t bring me back. You’re wanted. You can just say you lost me. That it was all a big misunderstanding… I’ve got this whole thing recorded… it could be used against you. You won’t do that to yourself.”</p>
<p>“No, Toki. I wouldn’t do that.”</p>
<p>“I could have escaped at any time. When you were sleeping… In the forest… but I stayed.”</p>
<p>“You stayed.” </div> 

<div class="page" data-page="41"></p>
<p>“You know why?”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“The same reason you’re here. You want to know… I want to know.”</p>
<p>“To know what?”</p>
<p>“What it’s like to be free of this voice. Of Sally.”</p>
<p>I looked down at the little guy. He was torn. I didn’t know what to say to him, or anything. I couldn’t figure out who I was talking to anymore. These didn’t seem like the ramblings of an AI. He was scared for himself, knowing of his own being. It didn’t seem like the machine, it seemed like the Rabbit. I found a plate downstairs and set a dish of water out for Toki to drink from.</p>
<p>I tried to get some sleep, but mostly stared at the back of my eyelids while I listened to the highway. Toki was set to get us up before the van arrived so we could be ready. I drifted some, caught a few moments of restfulness, but the hard floor under this thin blanket offered little in the way of comfort. The dark sky soon turned to ash, and then a faint blue as Toki stirred. My skin was dirty from the forest and this floor and my hair had grown oily, and I needed a good shower and a change of clothes. I tried the hot water but it came out only cold. I tried anyway, to shower for a few moments in the cold water, washing what I could of the last few days off. With no soap I was just mixing water and oil, and but it was better than nothing. I dried off with the blanket put my dirty clothes back on, strapped the bag across my shoulder and lifted Toki into it. We headed downstairs to wait by the front door. We waited a few minutes.</p>
<p>“What time is it?”</p>
<p>“6:28 Frank.”</p>
<p>Occasionally, a car would pass by. The house was quiet, and the highway offered only a few cars at this hour. A white van pulled up in front of the house.</p>
<p>“What time is it?”</p>
<p>“6:30.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>I walked from the house to the van, slid open the back door and climbed inside. We headed to Atlantis. <a href="/item46"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
</div> 

<div class="page" data-page="42">
<p>PART IV</p>
<p>Atlantis</p>
<p>We drove for hours. I slept most of the way. The driver didn’t speak to me, except when it came time for Toki and I to slip into the underbelly of the Van. We were headed for the border. The place was supposed to be in the middle of nowhere, on some old land trust. I’d heard of places like it before. I don’t think it was the only one, but it could have been the first one of these places to spring up. Now, why Atlantis in particular? They had something going on there. It was mentioned on the streams, through the glass… but the reports were vague. It seemed that there were a lot of questions about the place. They were cut off, had their own inner workings… let the people stay, work, produce, live. They made it sound like North Korea in the early part of the century, but the stories were mixed. Sympathizers and critics, butting heads over something they’re miles removed from. But there was Connor Sullivan<a href="/item47"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a>, the ex founder… he was the one that caused the most trouble, would be the loudest on the streams. It was this constant back and forth that made it difficult. The difference between a place like church, and a place like Atlantis, is that church, even with its secrecy, always had a flow of visitors. They’d go in, they’d do their thing, and they’d come out. It was that permeability that made it alright for the time being. This new president obviously had problems with some of it, with her open book past and all, but she hadn’t gone after them yet. Atlantis was another story. Their remoteness and secrecy caused the tensions between here and there. They were barely allowed to trade with the Main State anymore. Any large shipments coming out would be searched and seized. They claimed it was biological warfare… that Atlantis was brewing something foul. You could never tell for sure. So, to keep themselves afloat, they had ties with a few of these other communities, would send things in and out in small batches, and to other states. They didn’t really believe in keeping things civil in a world that wouldn’t drop the suspicion. It wouldn’t have mattered so much if it weren’t for their secrecy, for their want to stay private. They kept to themselves. If you wanted something made without technology, that’s where you got it. With this new president, I don’t know if that would last very long. There was a perimeter of towers that blocked transmissions in and out, nothing, no signal would leave. It made it hard for cameras to go in and report live… so anything that was reported came from hidden cameras, recorded and documented and sent back to be aired. They were against the cameras too. They didn’t have the luxury of paying the brutish Alter Boys, so it was up to the public to self-report anything suspicious, or so they said. I hadn’t known anyone to go, to live there, to be there. It seemed ridiculous. This place, the one place in the entire Main State that could get the memory off this bunny, was a budding population of anti-main-state paranoid hippies, or so they said. They called themselves Atlanteans, after the lost city on the water. Apparently, you can get some nice fabric there. From what I hear there’s a good chance it’s all-natural, a thing that’s pretty hard to come by now. I might pick me up some… maybe bring it back and sell it… keep it around as an artifact of a world that wasn’t. I don’t know if we could get in… we were bringing supplies through… plumbing supplies… a regular run… an order that would be stopped at the last border before we headed in. We were probably going to be searched by a random inspection. They’d do that. I don’t know if it would be the auditors or what, maybe a Main State trooper. Could be any one of them that searches this truck. We were close. We’d been driving for almost 12 hours now, having stopped for snacks. Toki and I would stay hidden in the van while the driver would go in. We’d wait in the belly of the truck until we were back on the road, free from cameras, free from any static or personal recordings. The driver brought his own food, so he wouldn’t be buying for two. I can only imagine past drivers whose buying habits were registering. If they bought too much for themselves, they’d either be marked for an unhealthy lifestyle, or be picked up for their crime of human smuggling. He had done this before.</p>
</div> 

<div class="page" data-page="43"></p>
<p>The day rolled on and the sun hung low in the sky.</p>
<p>“From here on in, you got to stay below.” The driver gave me a pill to fight the claustrophobia… muscle relaxer and anti-anxiety. He motioned to me and Toki to get comfortable as he pulled over to help us in. The equipment rolled up on springs, the floor pivoting up with another turn of a loose bolt and our quarters were revealed. It was padded, dark, comfortable but convenient. The hollowed out battery compartment, just deep enough to lie down in. I took a deep breath as I felt the meds kick in and the panic melt away. I headed down. He closed the door on us and the world disappeared. Time slowed with the drugs, I don’t know how long were there for. The van was mostly steady, then I could feel us pull off the main highway. Stop signs, left turns, right turns, my body shifting under the force of the turns with nothing to hold on to but to push off on the sides of this dark, coffin like enclosure. We kept on these back-roads for a while until we came close to what was probably the border. The car was stopped for a few minutes and I heard the driver door slam, followed by the sliding door just inches above me. Footsteps above my face, metal scraping against metal. A few more footsteps. Sounded like two or three people in the Van, searching for anything suspicious… searching for me perhaps. They were still, but still they were there. I could not hear the words, but only murmurs, soft and faint through my chamber door. Now they were shuffling but still not leaving pushing metal against metal, the scrapes echoing through this tiny chamber, stinging my ears. But still, they could not find it, could not find the way in here. And soon the shuffling and footsteps turned to silence, and murmuring questions became empty air. The door above me slid shut and the driver returned to his seat. We drove on.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes and tried to rest, and for the first time since we left I found myself slipping away, deeply to sleep, comfortable in this tiny space. It was once again the sound of the sliding door that woke me from my slumber. And with a few alterations to the space above me, the door cracked open, my eyes adjusting to the light of the car, and flashlights that shone in my eyes.</p>
<p>“Hi Frank. I’m Selene.” <a href="/item48"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a><a href="/item49"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>She stood aside the driver, resting her hand on his back, looking down at Toki and I. She bent towards us, and extended her arm. She pulled me upright, my back flinching at the change in position. Her hands, soft and slight were warm to the touch. She looked to the driver. “Thanks for the good work. You can bring the rest of the stuff to the mechanical house.”</p>
<p>I dusted myself off and stood up outside the van. The sun had set and the stars were bright overhead as we were far from light of the city. She looked me up and down, and stopped on Toki.</p>
<p>“So, what have we got here?”</p>
<p>“This is Toki.”</p>
<p>“Toki? Nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you too. Miss Selene.”</p>
<p>She smiled at him and back up at me.</p>
<p>“Well. I don’t greet every visitor or newcomer, just the ones who come in tucked in the underbelly of a moving van. What exactly brought you in this way?”</p>
<p>“Well Selene. It’s Toki, and myself. We are the reason.”</p>
<p>“Come to get away?”</p>
<p>“Came to get answers.”</p>
<p>“Answers. That’s a tough one. We’ve got mostly questions. Few answers but I can do my best. Before we get into the details, come with me. Let’s get you some food and water. Get cleaned up a bit.”</p>
<p>“I thought you’d never offer.”</p>
</div> 

<div class="page" data-page="44"></p>
<p>She led us into the curving streets of Atlantis, under cloth, pulled tight above our heads. We walked passed the tents and enclosures, taught and sturdy that lined the street. You might think a heavy wind or rain would bring it down, but its architects built it sturdy, withstanding the seasons since it’s creation. The street was alive as people and a young woman walked passed, smiling at Selene, eyeing us out as we followed closely behind. She wore loose fitting clothes, layered and folding, keeping her warm in the cool night as she wandered these curved streets. We arrived at a door, and Selene spoke.</p>
<p>“Aengus.”</p>
<p>There was a rustling from inside as footsteps neared the entrance. The cloth pulled back and there stood Aengus, a man whose years had seemingly stopped, old and young at the same time. He stood, tall and proud, the lines in his face marked his years, and highlighted his smile as his eyes squinted and perked at the sight of us.</p>
<p>“This is Frank and Toki.”</p>
<p>“Ah. It’s good to meet you. Frank. Toki.”</p>
<p>He reached his hand out and I grabbed it. “Of course, Aengus.”</p>
<p>He looked to Selene, and thought a moment. “Come in. Let’s get you some fresh clothes and something to drink.”</p>
<p>Inside his tent shelves of books lined the walls, softly lit in the warm light from the lamps below. It was comfortable. An old study transplanted. He passed through another set of cloth as he fetched the water.</p>
<p>“Aengus will be able to help you with that bunny. He’s a doctor. He knows about them.”</p>
<p>“Can I take the mask and collar off.”</p>
<p>“Not yet. We’ll take care of him tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Please. Sit down.”</p>
<p>I sat in a comfortable chair of carved wood, hand stitched and finely detailed. “This is one of ours… the chair. It’s made here by one of the residents. He does nice work.”</p>
<p>“It’s beautiful.” It wasn’t an empty compliment, it was built to perfection. “And you… where do you fit in with all of this?”</p>
<p>“Members of my family were some of the original founders. We’ve been here a while. I was born here.”</p>
<p>“A true Atlantean. And Aengus?”</p>
<p>“He’s the surgeon; one of the people that keeps everybody healthy. Takes care of us. He’ll take care of you tomorrow.” <a href="/item50"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a><a href="/item51"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>“You have a lot of family here?”</p>
<p>“Had a brother, but he left. Wanted the luxuries of Main State.”</p>
<p>Her eyes focused on me and the bunny for a moment and Aengus returned.</p>
<p>“This should do. There’s some cool water and some hot tea. Should get you right. And a few things to dig into here for our friend Toki. I’ll make sure you get something more substantial to eat, Frank. Looks like you could use a good meal.”</p>
<p>“Thank you Aengus.”</p>
<p>“You can just call me Gus.”</p>
<p>“Alright Gus.”</p>
<p>“Would you like a tour?”</p>
<p>“I would love one.”</p>
<p>“I won’t be joining you two.” Selene stood and made her way to the entrance. “But I’ll catch up with you tomorrow. See how you’re doing.”</p>
</div> 

<div class="page" data-page="45"></p>
<p>“It was a pleasure.” Gus and I stood as she left.</p>
<p>“Now, Mr. Toki. Would you like to come?”</p>
<p>“I would Gus. May I call you Gus?”</p>
<p>“I’d prefer it.”</p>
<p>Gus led us out into the streets, illuminating the darkness with a small lantern. We walked from the outer streets to the spokes that would lead us across Atlantis, homes, and enclosures that seemed identical from the last. I noticed, above doors, at openings in the structure, and at the corners and crossings of streets, patterns of quilted color, markings that I could not yet read or decipher. I carried Toki in front of me, who was watching as we walked. He had probably already understood their meanings. I asked Gus to explain.</p>
<p>“The markings? They are our signatures. It’s how we do business here. Part of what makes this place run internally. When we cut ourselves off from the Main State, we cut ourselves off from the transactions that make its economy what it is. This is our system. This is our trade. It’s both craft, a language, and our system of currency. On the outside of the homes is the language. We produce the wool here, and get the cotton from one of the vertical farms I’ll be showing you. We spin and finish the fabric, dye it with a special process. It’s all part of being here. It’s worked so far.” <a href="/item52"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a><a href="/item53"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>“And how many residents and families?”</p>
<p>“There’s a few thousand families, residents somewhere in the tens of thousands.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t see from where we stood, but the streets must have gone all the way around.</p>
<p>“And what do you do when the population grows?”</p>
<p>“We build out. It’s a series of rings. Each ring holds more than the last. We build out from the center as the population grows. If it shrinks, which it’s only done a few times, we pull back in again. It’s all centered around the school and the farms, which are on the main boulevard to the landscape outside.”</p>
<p>As we approached the center the fabric overhead stopped and I could see the towers. Vertical glass structures that rose into the sky. They were the vertical farms that kept the population fed.</p>
<p>“This is your source of food?”</p>
<p>“We’re very proud of it. These were the first two. They don’t feed everyone anymore. At first we had an overabundance, but have since had to build auxiliary farms on the outsides… the islands, we call them. There’s a few islands outside the main rings with other functions for us. It’s the mechanics that keep this place going.”<a href="/item54"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>“Impressive.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>The streets opened to the inner circle, which, with it’s slightly rolling landscape, clusters of tall trees, and winding paths that lined pools of water, it reminded me of the parks back home. The trees were lit with occasional flashes of light as people passed beneath.</p>
<p>“This is the oasis.”</p>
<p>“You make this?”</p>
<p>“It was here, mostly as it is now, when the founders got the land.”</p>
<p>“We’re on a land trust.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. The founders had ties to wealthy energy folks. They were able to set this up as an experiment that turned into what it is now.”</p>
<p>“It’s beautiful. It really is.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. We take care of it. It’s not always easy, and with this population the way it is, we’ve had to modify some of our original laws. But it’s the way it is, and here we are. Just take it in, enjoy it.”</p>
</div> 

<div class="page" data-page="46"></p>
<p>We stood there for a moment. The place was quiet. I could see the other farms in the distance, the trees obscuring the façade of the far side of the inner circle. I relaxed for a bit, but the muscle relaxers were wearing off. My back ached, complaining about the last leg of the journey. We were here, safe for the moment.</p>
<p>We stayed with Gus that night and I slept on the couch in the main living area, Toki on the chair next to me. I didn’t want to let him out of my sight, but figured we were safe enough with Gus here, with one of the caretakers of this place.</p>
<p>I woke up to the sun pouring in. I hadn’t noticed it last night, but it wasn’t fully enclosed. The folds of the fabric made way for the sun and air. Gus appeared and pulled on a rope that lead to a pulley above us. The fabric roof contracted revealing the blue sky above us. The day was beautiful.</p>
<p>“Tea is ready if you want some. And there’s some oatmeal if you’d like. It will start you off right. I’ve also got a change of clothes for you. Should fit you.”</p>
<p>I ate, quickly. Starved for nutrition and refreshed from a good night’s sleep. I changed into the clothes he gave me, and looked like a regular Atlantean.</p>
<p>“Frank.”</p>
<p>“Yes Toki?”</p>
<p>“You look like a million little Atlantean patterns.”</p>
<p>“Did you just make a joke?”</p>
<p>“I did. Are you amused?”</p>
<p>“In one way or another, yes. I don’t know if it’s you or the joke that’s funnier.”</p>
<p>“It’s probably the joke. I believe that with the right delivery it would really get someone going.”</p>
<p>“Well. Save it. Maybe they have an improv group here… you could test out your stand-up.”</p>
<p>“That sounds fun. I’ll start working on some more material.”</p>
<p>He jumped up to the couch and put his head down, watching me fumble with the robe I was given.</p>
<p>“Frank. Are you going to give me up today?”</p>
<p>“No, Toki. Why would you ask that?”</p>
<p>“After the surgeon takes care of me. Is he going to put me back together?”</p>
<p>I stopped pulling at my clothes and turned to him. “You’re going to be put back together. You’ll be alright.”</p>
<p>I didn’t know if that was the truth. I knew the surgeon had to cut him open. I knew he would have to take care of his insides. The inside of his head knowing more than he was letting on. Al’s words rang in my head, “So the bunny knows a little bit about a lot of things, and won’t tell nobody nothing.” It was true. I don’t know what was happening in there… what was causing his fits of speech, why he couldn’t get the memory. I was only hoping that Gus could help and it seemed as if he’d done this sort of thing before. He came back into the room and took at look me.</p>
<p>“Looking sharp.”</p>
<p>“When in Rome.”</p>
<p>“When in Atlantis. You two ready?”</p>
<p>“I am. Toki, how about you?”</p>
<p>“Frank. Gus, to be honest. No.”</p>
<p>“Toki. Don’t be nervous. I’ve been doing this for years.”</p>
<p>“And you will put me back together?”</p>
<p>“I will put you back together.”</p>
<p>“Can I ask you something?”</p>
<p>“Anything.”</p>
<p>“What about Sally? She’ll know.”</p>
</div> 

<div class="page" data-page="47"></p>
<p>“I will be honest. That is a problem. Is it alright if we don’t let Sally ask you anymore questions?”</p>
<p>“I would like it if she didn’t.”</p>
<p>“Alright Toki. I think I can take care of her while I’m in there.”</p>
<p>“Thank you Gus.”</p>
<p>Gus winked at Toki, who cocked his head back, tapped his foot instead.</p>
<p>“Come on Frank. You’re going to see the more advanced side of Atlantis today.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like fun.”</p>
<p>We made our way back to the Oasis and walked through to the other side. The water was sparkling, a stream running into it from the center of the main boulevard, bridges at every cross street. As we walked along the edge I found myself directly in line with the oasis and the boulevard. The snow covered mountains in the distance, hidden almost completely by the atmosphere, were a backdrop to the pool of water and tall trees in front of us, the boulevard parting the streets and neighborhoods, giving view to the world beyond. We walked past neighborhoods, bustling with activity. While at night the walls were shut, in the daylight they were pulled back revealing the streets and neighborhoods beyond, through houses and workshops filled with people, working and playing. We kept on towards one of the outer islands, where Gus’ lab was. <a href="/item55"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>Unlike the rest of Atlantis, it was not built from cloth and pole. It was metal and glass. A modern structure. The islands were like this. They existed as modern facilities. Powered, bright, a takeaway from Main State. I felt at ease, and uncomfortable at the same time, like an imposter, as if they’d recognize me as an outsider amidst my natural habitat.</p>
<p>“Here we are. This is where we do our good work.”</p>
<p>The place was a modern laboratory. If you didn’t know you just walked out of a time warp, you might suspect you were on a high tech campus somewhere in Cum Laude City.</p>
<p>“Morning Gus.”</p>
<p>A young, eager assistant was waiting for him.</p>
<p>“Morning Ferguson.”</p>
<p>“And who do we have here?”</p>
<p>“This is Frank, and Toki. We’ll be taking care of Toki today.”</p>
<p>“Morning Frank. Morning Toki.”</p>
<p>Toki looked out from my bag. “Morning. Is everyone here nicknamed Gus?”</p>
<p>“No Toki. You can call me Sonny.”</p>
<p>“Frank. This is great material. The stand up is going to kill.”</p>
<p>“Keep a list Toki. Just keep a list. We’ll practice when you’re out.”</p>
<p>“Alright Toki. Sonny is going to take you while I talk to Frank for a minute.”</p>
<p>I looked down at him as I pulled him from the bag. This would be the second time I let him out of my sights since we started. The first time he was almost eaten.</p>
<p>“It’ll be alright. Sonny will take care of you.”</p>
<p>I handed him off to Sonny, who cradled him in his arms. I wanted to go with him, through those doors, to make sure there was nothing in there that would steal him away again, to keep the memory safe and to make this all worth it.</p>
<p>When Sonny had left the room Gus started in.</p>
<p>“Frank. What do you know about your father and the bunny?”</p>
<p>“I know my father was up to something… I don’t know what. From what we could piece together, the two of them were connected in some kind of drug smuggling ring. It’s crazy. It’s not like him to go out and deal drugs. What was he doing it for?”</p>
<p>“Well. I’ll tell you what. He wasn’t all bad. We are aware of what your father was into. Not him in particular, but people like him. Activists.”</p>
</div> 

<div class="page" data-page="48"></p>
<p>“Yeah. That sounds like him.”</p>
<p>“You know the woman Toki mentioned? Sally?”</p>
<p>“I do, yes.”</p>
<p>“She’s not a woman, but a program that works for Calico. She looks after all the little devices and Tokis of the world. She’s the brain behind the distribution of a prediction machine that Calico runs. So, through all of the spies out there, fingers and watchers that exist, like Toki, she watches for patterns, for habits, for the needs of the population and she takes care to make sure the world is ready. She makes sure the hospitals are stocked, and that the doctors are aware of outbreaks and know what to ask when patients come in. She makes sure they have what they need on hand to take care of the population. And it’s things like Toki that help her do this.” <a href="/item56"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>“So how does this translate to drug trafficking… I can see where it’s going but there’s something missing…”</p>
<p>“And that’s what is in Toki’s head and it’s why they wanted him back so badly.”</p>
<p>“And I ran off with him…”</p>
<p>“Yes. They want to figure out how it’s working.”</p>
<p>“The trafficking.”</p>
<p>“Sally isn’t perfect. She makes mistakes. She makes mistakes sometimes because she misreads the information, and she makes mistakes sometimes because the data is bad. Most times the data is bad because of natural hiccups, but sometimes those mistakes are made on purpose. It doesn’t happen often but it does happen. When she does get a bad set of instructions, prescription drugs and medical supplies go where they’re not intended to go, and this isn’t always a bad thing. When you make mistakes on purpose, and you make them carefully, you can push supplies to somewhere very specific, places that don’t have good medical care, places that are underprivileged, or where large populations outnumber capable medical professionals, and even places off the grid, in the middle of nowhere, like this.” <a href="/item57"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a><a href="/item58"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
<p>“This is what my father was doing.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Can you just give me a minute?”</p>
<p>It made sense knowing his personality that he would do something like this, but there was still a lot that went unanswered. Maybe after the surgery would I finally be able to have some of these unknowns come to light. Perhaps through the revelation of his daily life would we be able to turn the questions of his methods into answers. An alternative would be that Gus, and a few others here knew exactly how he was doing it, and were in some way involved in the manipulation of this system. It would make sense, then, that knowing I would want the memories, and these memories might point a guilty finger to parties that might be within the walls of this place, that I might not be allowed to see them. That they would be destroyed along with Toki, on the other side of those walls as I waited. I watched Gus as he fumbled with is pen. A few minutes ago, a man who once looked poised and together, looked nervous and apprehensive. If I was allowed to have the memory, would I even be allowed to leave?</p>
<p>“Frank. There’s another dimension to Toki’s memory that you should be aware of.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“The pilot, the thing that’s in his head. It’s brought on some changes within him, caused a reaction in his immune system, specifically in his brain that has helped him cope with its existence.”</p>
<p>“And what do you need me to do?”</p>
<p>“Well, you have inherited the bunny, albeit he belongs to Calico, correct?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Well. The reason the memories are hard to get to, the reason Sally was never able to get to them, was that they were never within the pilot. They were stored in the biological brain.”</p>
<p>“In the brain of the bunny?”</p>

<p>“We’ve seen it happen. And there’s the problem. We scan his memory, and will be able to get the memory off him, but this leaves us in a unique position.”</p>
<p>“You can get the memory?"</p>
<p>“Yes, but Toki himself is the real issue.”</p>
<p>“How so?”</p>
<p>“Has he been stuttering? Speech problems?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, actually.”</p>
<p>“That’s not the pilot. It’s the bunny. He’s learned to control the pilot… not the other way around.”</p>
<p>“Toki?”</p>
<p>“… has become more than just the bunny.”</p>
<p>“With a reaction to the pilot, his body learned to use the hardware as another lobe. The software created to control his motor function and turn him into a puppet, was accessed by the brain.”</p>
<p>“So what does this mean for us? For Toki?”</p>
<p>“It means, if you were considering getting rid of him, you should be aware that he is self-aware. You’re dealing with something that has become very self aware.”</p>
<p>“And what do you suppose I do with him?”</p>
<p>“It’s up to you, but he might be better staying here. You have a bit of a problem yourself, don’t you?”</p>
<p>And here it was. I’d be prisoner.</p>
<p>“I sure do.”</p>
<p>“Well, you can stay here as long as you like until you figure it out.”</p>
<p>“You’re going to go in and work on Toki?”</p>
<p>“I will as soon as I know you’re alright with us cutting him open and seeing what we can see.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead.”</p>
<p>“Alright, It’ll take a few hours, but we’ll get him back to you.”</p>
<p>The blue sky and sunlight lit the walls and patterns, but with the thought of staying here forever, I got nervous and jealous. Jealous of the people that could come and go, who had a house that wasn’t being searched, and business acquaintances who were now under more scrutiny. They would find out about these things, one way or another. I wandered through the oasis while thinking of Toki, myself, Matilda and Omer. I wanted there to be an easy solution. I was just going to get rid of the bunny and head back to Main State. Make up some lie and plead a bargain. Maybe end up doing a judge ordered pokey-stick highway cleanup.</p>
<p>For a few hours I wandered the streets, always keeping the Oasis within my sight. It’s the beacon that grounds the whole place. And kept me from getting off and not finding my way back. I didn’t want anything to do with this place any more. I couldn’t tell if they were threatening me, or if it was genuine. I couldn’t tell if his offer was genuine for Toki, to live here. Sounds like the story about your aging dogs, farms, and lots of land to chase chickens. All I wanted was the memory back. Maybe I could just cut a deal with Calico, find my way out of this jam. I’d just need the memory. One for myself and one for them. I’d need to find a way back, a way out of here. A way back to Main State. I could tell them that I stole the bunny. Explain everything. Explain that all I wanted was the memory back. Maybe they’d let me have it. Maybe they would have done that all along. If only I’d stayed, never come out here, never brought Matilda and Omer into it. We’d be happy, record free. Hours passed and I didn’t want to see anymore of this place. I headed back to the lab, maybe to wait there for him, to see how it was going, and to find out about my fate. The wind kicked dirt in my face as I crossed the Oasis back to the lab. The place had filled since the morning; people waited like an ER in any Main State Hospital, desperate, but hopeful. I sat down to make myself comfortable, next to an old man complaining that his thumb was swollen and disfigured. I just wanted to leave. Sonny came in a while later. “Frank, would you come with me?”</p>
<p>I followed him into the back of the lab, when I found Toki, unconscious, lying on an operating table. They had cut him open to get at what they needed.</p>

<div class="page" data-page="50"></p>
<p>“We took some precautions. As you can see… no more connection to Sally, even without the mask and collar.” He held up a signal tracker and found nothing. “It’s only him in there now. You can go talk.”</p>
<p>“And the memory.”</p>
<p>“How could I forget. We were able to get it.”</p>
<p>“Can I have it?”</p>
<p>“It’s not really my call. I’ll go find Gus.”</p>
<p>I was right. They wanted it as badly as I did. Except, it would keep them out of jail to hang on to… funny thing about that… it would keep me out of jail if they would give it up… and now, we were at direct odds… that is, until she walked in. Selene burst through the door into the room. “Gus, Sonny… there’s something you should see.”</p>
<p>And there it was, on the screen she held in her hand, a news report. There were reports of an augmented human causing havoc in the subways… the TV crews had just arrived, and already the president was issuing a statement. They were blaming this all on Atlantis… it looked like I wouldn’t be going home so soon after all. <a href="/item59"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a><a href="/item60"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a></p>
